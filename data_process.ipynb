As soon as someone shows interest in me, however, regardless of whether I am interested in them, I start to shut down and become anti-social. I stop thinking of things to say, and just am overall a way more boring person. I think this has less to do with being an TYPE_MENTION and instead to do with the fact that I have severe adjustment disorder and depression.|||Does learning latin mean learning to read it, learning to speak it \\\"properly,\\\" or something else entirely? What level of mastery is necessary before you can start to see benefits in learning other Romance languages? I'm starting to get interested in picking this up as a hobby. Thanks so much for sharing such an interesting video.|||Whoops, my bad for assuming! Thanks for all of your kindness.|||Thanks for the advice! I appreciate it. Do you think I'll be screened out on GPA alone at any of those? And for the letter of rec, who should I ask? Does it not make much of a difference?|||This is so accurate. I've never had that articulated so eloquently. Thank you for clearing up a part of inferior COGFUNC_MENTION.|||Many TYPE_MENTION's are in my personal experience, although that means pretty much nothing. TYPE_MENTION's in leaderships positions tend to be less machiavellian and actually inspire real love and admiration from their subordinates. You have a natural tool kit to make people believe in themselves. Do the best you can to produce good work and make people at your workplace feel like they can trust you, and I'm sure you can leverage your COGFUNC_MENTION into a leadership position where you can enact your NF dreams onto the workplace. :)|||Where'd you go for undergrad, if you don't mind me asking? I wish I'd gone somewhere else for undergrad, tbh.|||I was wrong, that was an up and coming korean build gaining traction, but not FOTM there yet. It worked really well as a chase / anticarry build, almost permaslow with iceborn and her Q, and 40% CDR with the right runes and masteries. Challenging smite made you really tanky too, along with going full tank after that, although I think warrior into iceborn would have been better with the armor penetration helping to boots sheen procs.|||Look at the top engineering schools on US News And World Report. They have a list of the schools with the greatest research expenditures there. Also, try to narrow down your interests within bioengineering research. Do you want to work with MEMS, neuroengineering, biomaterials, tissue engineering, or something else? Find a school with a lot of research expenditures and some programs specifically for your research interests. Good luck!|||That sounds terrible. I hope you are able to work through everything. You are going through hell right now and handling it like a champ.|||of course!|||I had very similar issues as a kid, alcoholism and my dad hitting me when he drank. Verbal abuse and constant criticism, all that fun stuff. It scars you, fam. I get it. I'm sorry you had to go through all of that, I know how much it can hurt.When you're ready, you should try it out again with the promise that you'll be honest with yourself and the therapist. Don't tell anyone, make sure its for you and you only. No need for that to be soon. I have been hating myself for most of my life and it just seems wrong to hate the only companion that will stick around with you for forever. About the thing you did when you went to therapy, it's so funny that you put it that way, I've done the same thing. I let my therapist talk about himself the whole time because I didn't want to open up. Eventually I stopped giving a fuck and just let him know what was going on. I went through 3 different therapists before I found the one I'm currently with that I like. I've cried, spent nights alone feeling more lonely than ever after therapy, but eventually it started to all feel better (only been in it for 3 months so take that with a grain of salt. I might be in a good mood and thats it.)That does make sense, I don't care the story myself, I'd find it more funny to say something crude at my wedding about how we met somewhere totally unromantic, haha, but it is a valid concern to say that. A lot of people are meeting online nowadays, so give it a try.No problem! I've been through many a rut before, whether imagined or real, and I understand what you're feeling right now.|||Oh god are we supposed to be good at flirting? hahahaha|||I don't know much about it myself, but many of my friends who enjoy coding found ways to monetize their passion. They developed websites for local businesses and friends and families.|||This sometimes really bothers me with my TYPE_MENTION best friend and TYPE_MENTION sister.|||OP isn't saying \\\"her derp only play meta\\\" though. OP is just asking why a pro would not want to pick up Kayle in this tank meta.

There's nothing anti-social about having casual sex.|||HAHAHA I love the image of the ENP's as the food testers!|||When I think about the fact that many people don't know anything about this, and will be voting on policies that affect Black Americans it really bums me out. I feel like I'm losing faith in America to ever change in any substantial way that helps Black people out.

Have you considered double majoring?|||that's valid, no worries. I've seen reddit at it's worst, and thats not below them.|||You replied to another commenter agreeing with you, not the OP. Just a heads up.|||Thanks for this.|||\\\"Look at this post we think is hateful. Reddit agrees with us because it is down voted!

I used to think I was an TYPE_MENTION and an TYPE_MENTION in my early MBTI days. Anyways, this stuff sucks though. I keep telling myself that I'm going to become a more solitary person, rely on no one but myself, and all that shit. Of course, I continue to make the same mistakes anyways, lol.

Edit: If you think evolution has a \\\"goal,\\\" then you are sorely mistaken.|||Same here! It's honestly so embarrassing.|||I think that I will try do a combination of both; stop asking myself these useless questions when it's not appropriate and not have my sense of self tied to these moments while also creating more time in my schedule to do things and forge my identity. I appreciate the answer, and I think it's something I might try to internalize form now on.|||How do you vent, then, if you don't mind me asking?|||Show me your peer reviewed research that proves that the majority of women are gossipy. Show me your intelligence and cognitive thinking.|||Ah I'm sorry, homie, but don't give up hope! I'm so sure you can get into content creation or find more fulfilling work. I hope everything works out.|||Anyone ever watch Cowboy Bebop? Just finished it up and it's got me in my feelings|||That's the most awkwardly typed sentence I've seen in a while. I'm sorry, but it's awful.|||33% TYPE_MENTION, 24% TYPE_MENTION, 14% TYPE_MENTION, 12% TYPE_MENTION, 5% TYPE_MENTION. May I ask what the airplane question was supposed to indicate? Great test, though, overall.|||Damn, I didn't even know that was a thing. I think I'll go with the HTC One M9 then instead of either of those, it seems like they aren't on the list. Thanks!|||Reddit can't counsel you into a better relationship, but a couple's therapist can. Do that, pronto. Individual therapy would help, too.You also should just try initiating stuff. Initiate date nights, inside movie nights, etc. This can't and won't replace therapy, but it will help you. Be united on this front. Fight for your marriage.These two in combination will change things.|||Where do you see yourself 5 years from now?|||Where do you see yourself 5 years from now?|||Once people started noticing I do this, I got labelled \\\"the Drifter.\\\"|||I'm sorry about this, this stuff isn't cool. Toxic masculinity has done so much in my life to fuck things up, and I see a lot of dudes in my position not understand that patriarchy and masculinity are to blame, not women. I've been where the OP is, and it sucks a lot. It can warp your thinking. You can't let that be an excuse to minimize another's person's suffering, though.|||I actually don't have as much of a read on people as other TYPE_MENTION's. I have to sit and reason out people's feelings.|||You were right. I was upset, and needed an outlet that didn't hurt people / ruin relationships. Thanks for your comment, I really appreciated it, and it helped me to calm down and see things in perspective.|||I've seen a lot of hate for the type-specific subreddits based mainly on the perception that they bring out the worst in the types. The circlejerks are real. (One time I saw a post on /r/TYPE_MENTION literally say that they were so good at reading people that they could understand a person better than they could themselves by talking to them for 5 minutes. I wish this was hyperbole.) That's mostly what I have seen and heard, but /u/madsweet might have their own reasons for their comment.|||HTC One M8 or the Moto X (2nd generation)?

Can someone explain them to me? Also, users of either/both phones, what did you think of your experiences? Thank you so much for all the help, /r/Android!|||It doesn't die, it grows and learns its way around the feeble defense mechanisms you used to protect yourself with. I'm sorry you are feeling pain. Your feelings are valid no matter how many years it's been and your input here is appreciated. Thank you for sharing.|||Good luck, those books are absolutely fantastic, aren't they?|||NTJ's and NTP's think very different from each other. It's not very useful to try to lump them together in terms of their cognitive thought processes. ---------**xNTP**NTP's have completely different functions that NTJ's NTP's want to detach themselves from their analyses of ideas and problems. This is due to COGFUNC_MENTION, introverted thinking, which wants clean perfect data and clear perfect logic moving from step to step to find a universal solution to a problem. [Michael Pierce](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmDcT_Pujk8vOcxk_IcnxtQ) describes this exceedingly well in his [\\\"Revisiting the Types: TYPE_MENTION\\\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0O4lDfzNLXI) video on Youtube. He talks about how Einstein, an TYPE_MENTION, different from Newton, an TYPE_MENTION. Einstein saw Newton's COGFUNC_MENTION methods, and started to wonder whether the they worked on all scales, large and small. He devised his theory of \\\"General Relativity,\\\" and worked for one simple universal equation to describe the universe. NTP's want to detach themselves from their conclusions and philosophy. Michael Pierce, as a whole, really well explains this, and I'd look into his channel if you want more information.**-NTJ**NTJ's, as COGFUNC_MENTION types, don't believe that one can or should detach themselves from their work. They are a part of their work, and their COGFUNC_MENTION, Extroverted Thinking, is looking for a here and now solution, rather than something that will always work. COGFUNC_MENTION says that the facts of each problem are unique and each problem should be looked at differently and solved on it's own in the most efficient manner. Extroverted functions are more \\\"objective\\\" and this is true for COGFUNC_MENTION -- TJ's tend to analyze the merits of an idea, or object, or whatever, by objective standards -- how fast does the car go? What is it's MPG? This is different from the \\\"Does this make sense?\\\" that COGFUNC_MENTION tries to achieve, because internal consistency that isn't useful isn't important to TJ's. They are more concerned with practicality and how the real world lines up.----------I didn't really want to get into COGFUNC_MENTION vs COGFUNC_MENTION, as that is probably the hardest thing to explain in typology and I'm sure others will answer with more knowledgeable responses, but they also see the world in fundamentally different ways before even deciding what they want to do with their perceptions. Here are two resources on COGFUNC_MENTION vs COGFUNC_MENTION if you want learn from people who've read Jung's materials:[Micheal Pierce on COGFUNC_MENTION vs COGFUNC_MENTION](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghnGzIiDTz4)[John Barnes on COGFUNC_MENTION vs COGFUNC_MENTION](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USzPndBNLbM)-----What makes you uncertain of your type?

Actually though, I've really gotten into baking to show my friends how much I care about them. Idk if this is an COGFUNC_MENTION thing (so few things are actual MBTI things) but the physical manifestation helps convince me and my friends that I care about them.|||Most people put 3 or 4 points into Q and then max W in my experience.|||I have family who work in medical devices and they tell me some infuriating stories, but nothing myself, haha.|||Don't worry about it, he's used to being forgotten.|||Of course. I am studying that, and it's super interesting. I know Biology students who got accepted into master's programs for it, so you wouldn't even need to go for a second bacc, just a two year master's!|||I haven't seen any Habesha people in a really long time, because of college, so I just wanted to say hi, lol. What do you think the primary obstacle is? Do you think it's going to be the lack of corporate sponsors, or his leftist views?|||I don't know if BME will suit me out not, I'm afraid I won't interact with people enough as an engineer. I love my classes right now, and if the workplace is like this, I think I can deal, haha. I will see after an internship how I feel about engineering. Its really interesting stuff and with BME you really can save the world. I highly recommend thinking about electrical or mechanical engineering and then applying to work for BME companies!|||I think that this does not hold up. Morality is just a label on whether an action or inaction is evil or justified. That's my understanding of the word at least, and if you have a different one, I'd love to hear it. But, operating on the idea that morality is just a label, it should be treated no differently from, for example, labelling a ball a color. It doesn't matter how inconsequential the ball is, it still is red or blue or green, or whatever.I think that the universal definition of evil is causing harm to things without justified reasons, and that every society and culture just has different justifications and definitions of harm. That is the universal nature of it for me.|||My TJ friends are constantly annoyed by all the inefficiency they see around them lol|||I fucking love / hate it here. What year are you? I'm a second year, and judging from this guy's jacket he is too, but I've never seen him.|||I think you fucked up and that it's time to learn from it and move on. Send one last message where you apologize without qualification, and that you hope that you can repair the relationship, and that you understand if she doesn't want to talk to you anymore. After that, it's in her hands.For future reference, just remember that other people see things you do as repetitive and boring and probably smile and listen to it anyways. It's not that you have to believe anything a friend says is interesting, it's just that you shouldn't make them feel like pieces of crap for sending you messages, which is what I'm guessing happened with your friend. Good luck, I hope everything works itself out!|||There was your mistake. People prefer that you throw live animals at their feet. Try again, but with a colony of tropical fire ants.|||Happy cake day!|||That thing is fucking awesome. Thanks for sharing it!|||Yeah, seriously, I'm sorry this group has been unable to get that you have been joking with them.|||Seriously what could she have done to be a \\\"hero\\\" in your books?|||You have good reason to. COGFUNC_MENTION has become the scapegoat for annoying behaviors in general. \\\"I have a problem with my room mate being stubborn so they must be an TYPE_MENTION how do I deal with them?\\\"|||Wouldn't COGFUNC_MENTION would be more careful and attempt to be more consistent?|||Trist too|||Have you ever participated in a Women's Studies program, or do you know anyone well who is/was? At my university, the course load includes heavy analysis of pop culture and promotes looking at national and global attitudes critically. I'm not suggesting you take a class or anything, but you should look up the coursework at your local university, and with an open mind you'll find it filled with critiques of the messages movies send, and music, and all sorts of popular mediums of communication, along with critical thinking in writing.|||Do you know the differences between extraverted sensation and intuition?|||As an insecure EN?P, I am definitely guilty of this, too.|||Hahaha. What's going on here? Why is this subreddit affiliated with /r/DarkEnlightenment and other neo-con/reactionary subs?|||A simple \\\"Hey, I see that you're still not over your ex. I understand that feeling, so I know it's generally not a good idea to date until you feel ready.

I will concede that the justification for those things came from a completely different line of reasoning, though.|||How? That song asks no questions about existence? I'm just curious, not looking down on you, fam.|||yikes|||What sorts of products do you work on? I'd love to work where you work, haha.|||Thanks for all the information, and for all your help!|||Yup, haha.|||These are actually all TYPE_MENTION stereotypes, haha.|||We can stop excusing it, though.|||Holy shit that was dope!

This is dopeness.|||It's true. TYPE_MENTION mentors look completely different from TYPE_MENTION mentors. The TYPE_MENTION, in my opinion, is more likely to be frustrated and annoyed when the student shows little progress, but be more honest. I see a classic TYPE_MENTION tutor in Dumbeldore, who employs a lot of the Socratic method with Harry, and a little bit of secrecy.|||Oh, you didn't buy a case from Otterbox or anything instead? Do their cases feel strong enough to withstand a fall?|||I apologize, I didn't mean anything other than I don't think there are any behaviors that indicate a person's sexual orientation other than their sexual orientation. That last sentence is most likely the offending one, so I apologize for it. It came off as condescending and patronizing.

Even reading 10 books a year probably puts you in the top 10 percent of first world adults.|||If I make a math mistake, and I erase my work and go on to solve the problem, does that mean that I censored myself? If I get mad at a friend and in the heat of the moment say something that goes too far, and I apologize and take it back, did I censor myself? Self censorship isn't a thing.

I just finished up critiquing a story.|||I totally forgot about that law. Thanks for the answer! What about interracial marriages between non White people? Were they also usually prohibited?|||He looks more like an TYPE_MENTION to me. I see COGFUNC_MENTION's sloppier reasoning that gets the job done, and a pragmatism like few others. I see a little bit of COGFUNC_MENTION in his language that he can access, but isn't dominant or auxiliary. He can make connections and tell metaphors thay illustrate his points stronger. He isn't anTYPE_MENTION; nearly everyone who he has worked with absolutely hates his guts. Leading with COGFUNC_MENTION would make that unlikely.|||What is your major? It doesn't help much, but if you are a STEM major, predict even more unpredictability, as some admissions committees look favorably upon them. As a AA STEM major future splitter with a great addendum, I feel like we are in very similar boats.|||That's a terrible comparison. It would be more like \\\"Being hungry sucks, I want to work on policy to reduce wealth inequality so many don't have to experience hunger, and to do that, I need an understanding of the root causes of wealth inequality and the demographics of the hungry, because a surface level understanding of this problem won't solve anything.\\\" Which is why they are going to college, for in depth study and to develop critical thinking skills.|||Are you sure this isn't an COGFUNC_MENTION thing instead of an IxFJ thing? I relate a LOT to this.|||Have you read into the cognitive functions and tried to figure out whether you are COGFUNC_MENTION-COGFUNC_MENTION or COGFUNC_MENTION-COGFUNC_MENTION?|||The first time I took the test, I got TYPE_MENTION. I stuck with it because the description sounded nice. Then I learned about the functions, and the description of COGFUNC_MENTION sounded so much better to me than COGFUNC_MENTION. (COGFUNC_MENTION is moral and would have hated slavery. COGFUNC_MENTION is sheeple who would have followed Hitler.) But reading through the TYPE_MENTION subreddit, I realized I didn't relate very much to it, and I was trying to convince myself I did. Edit: I realized that the stereotypes of COGFUNC_MENTION vs COGFUNC_MENTION were complete bullshit. I know that now, I didn't know that then.|||TIL disagreeing with someone on reddit's sexist opinion = PC nonsense.|||Maybe I'm just weird, but since I usually stick to the smaller subreddits, I remember account names.|||Do you live in the US?

I don't see any COGFUNC_MENTION in the clip. She doesn't emote a lot, which is more of an TYPE_MENTION trait. Her face stays very controlled. An TYPE_MENTION would sell well, but would emote a lot in order to connect to the interviewer and audience. I'm thinking that she's an TYPE_MENTION.|||This passage indicates COGFUNC_MENTION, and probably higher in your stack. COGFUNC_MENTION (found prominently in TJ's and less prominently in FP's) is concerned with the usefulness of a idea more so than learning an idea for purely understanding it, which is more often found in TP's and a little less commonly in FJ's. I would look into ExTJ, IxTJ, or possibly ExFP. ExFP's have tertiary COGFUNC_MENTION, which although not as prioritized as in TJ's, still shows up sometimes.Do you understand the perceiving functions?|||Thank you, you're absolutely god damn right.

They don't necessarily always overlap, like at my school. To graduate in 4 years, I had to take 16 units of science  / engineering a quarter for two years, and then 20 for the last two. It's very hard to keep your grades up. If you're sure about medical school, I'd advise just doing a major that interests you and additionally taking the requirements that don't get covered by your major.|||The writers keep extending the show for money smh.

Those two are the most common introductions for people discovering typology. As for the rest of it, every TYPE_MENTION (only two, admittedly.

Even  within the frame of your argument -- that evolution drives gender roles, and not socialization --  this doesn't make sense. This trait is purely advantageous; there's no negative for natural selection go phase out females who do well under pressure.Both do have testosterone. Cisgender men, of course, have greater testosterone than cisgender women, but the body's sensitivity to testosterone is also different. Your body uses testosterone for various purposes, and it is delivered to specific cells or tissues or organs to elicit a physiological reaction and not a psychological reaction.

Everyone thinks things and feels things. Everyone is able to notice details and think abstractly. Try reading up on the functions behind the letters. For example TYPE_MENTION's differ from TYPE_MENTION's in that they use more extroverted feeling and introverted thinking, whereas TYPE_MENTION's use more introverted feeling and extroverted thinking. The difference there is that TYPE_MENTION's have very strong personal values, and empathize through experience. They think in terms of consequences and not necessarily in terms of how a thing's inner workings function.TYPE_MENTION's place mode value on the feelings of a group around it. They are able to sympathize better than we can without experience. They are much more interested in ideas for their own sake and not necessarily their consequences in the real world.Which do you feel you do more of? I am stuck here myself because I can't figure out whether I prefer COGFUNC_MENTION-COGFUNC_MENTION or COGFUNC_MENTION-COGFUNC_MENTION. Another thing to consider is that you might be depressed.

That's why you'll see some more developed TYPE_MENTION's actually be well organized and driven.As for the selfishness and moodiness and anti-social tendencies, well those are stereotypes associated with COGFUNC_MENTION.

This heavily depends on what you want to work with. There are three important departments of engineers at most biomedical device companies -- Quality, R&amp;D, and Manufacturing / Product Management.

If you want to go into devices that don't use circuits, ME's, ChemE's and Materials Science Engineers will be more prevalent in R&amp;D. In Manufacturing, there are a lot of MechE's, a few BME's, and a few ChemE's. A lot fo BME's go into Quality Engineering, too. R&amp;D is where the technical skills each degree offers are more important, but in the other two certifications and on the job training are more important.

I know what you're referring to, the bit about how white people often don't understand racism. But that's not a personal belief that I hold without strong evidence. Study after study with white people in the present, and in the past, show that White people have consistently always thought that racism was never an issue. There are studies from the 50's that show that white people thought racism wasn't a problem back then. This isn't a generalization, these are years longs, and decades of survey work, analysis, and deconstruction by people much smarter than me. You can read them for yourself. When a study says that the majority of white people do not believe racism is a problem, and than they are the primary victims of racism today, that doesn't mean that all white people do, that more than 50% surveyed do. When these studies are repeated and analyzed by many different minds, and the all these different minds reach the same result, it's not just a generalization. [Here is the first article I found, and you can go to its sources and decide for yourself](https://news.vice.com/article/half-of-america-thinks-we-live-in-a-post-racial-society-the-other-half-not-so-much) Racism is not simple anymore like it used to be. Racist laws today don't use the words \\\"black\\\" to discriminate against black people. This is hard for people to understand if you're not living the experience of being held back by intentionally vague structures of power that uphold white supremacy, and that explains why racism is hard to understand for a lot of White Americans. Some are woke, but too many fall into the trap of \\\"I didn't/ They didn't use the word \\\"black\\\" its not racist.\\\" If you have any credible study at all to the contrary, that shows that the majority of white people understand racism, then please share.EDIT: [Here are some studies that show that many white people think they are more hardworking, and intelligent than black people.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/12/01/chris-rock-is-right-white-americans-are-a-lot-less-racist-than-they-used-to-be/) There are many other interesting tidbits in there if you want to read more.|||Thank you, I appreciate it!

But regardless, who cares if your peers are having a ton of casual sex? Don't judge them if you're not about that life, just look for someone who views sex as something as intimate as you do. You may not realize it, but being judgemental or bitter, especially in regards to sex, is not going to help you find that special someone that I'm sure you would find otherwise. You sound like a caring individual, and someone who has a lot to offer someone in a relationship, you just gotta get your head out of your ass here. Sorry for being so harsh, but I promise you that moping about \\\"this generation\\\" isn't going to help you find what you're looking for. I wish you the best of luck, I'm sure you'll find someone!|||Some people are really even on some of the functions, I don't like the letters binary myself. I like the percentages more, haha.

Some people I know make a lot of money ($15-20 an hour) taking organized notes and giving them to engineers with disabilities (learning, physical, etc.) who can't take notes. It's almost always done through the Disabilities Service Center, or whatever equivalent is at your school. Especially for bigger majors like Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science, you can easily get these types of jobs on campus.|||I'll have to consider that for when I move out!|||Usually with the junglers I play, it's not a good idea.

Have you done any research into Carl Jung's work, on which MBTI is based?|||Using the letter dichotomies is not the most accurate way to type people. For example, if we are having a conversation about how my aunt and uncle just died, I'm going to be talking about heavy stuff. I might be more expressive than usual, or cry. This might lead you to think I'm a \\\"feeler.\\\" However, a conversation about how I'm making a heart rate monitor for a class I'm in right now might make you think I am more of a \\\"Thinker.\\\" Obviously a conversation does not change my personality type. What conversations can show is that I have a preference for Extroverted Intuition, Introverted thinking, Extroverted Feeling, and Introverted Sensing. You can glean from things I say how my mind works, and see those processes going on. Warning, however: It's not always what people say, but how they express it that shows their type.The dichotomies also aren't as in depth. For example, they don't suggest how TYPE_MENTION's feel extremely strong feelings that they are often overwhelmed by, and instead paint them as cold, soulless robots who want to impose how they view the world onto others. I suggest you learn the cognitive functions, and the attitude preferences! It's a lot of information, but it's worth it.|||There's a reason most white people aren't offended when you call them honkeys/crackers.

A little bit of nuance due to COGFUNC_MENTION vs COGFUNC_MENTION. I don't think Hitler was an TYPE_MENTION. I haven't seen any evidence of dominant COGFUNC_MENTION or repressed COGFUNC_MENTION. I think what we do see is Hitler showed excessive COGFUNC_MENTION-COGFUNC_MENTION loops, classic of unhealthy TYPE_MENTION's, that lose touch with reality.|||LMAO I'm from the west coast and at first I was like \\\"Damn I've never seen anyone thank the DMV.

I didn't have the time to thank you earlier. I appreciate your perspective; it gives me hope.|||I don't think bojack is an TYPE_MENTION, personally. He doesn't emote well (COGFUNC_MENTION), he doesnt make decisions based on logical consistency or based in a dispassionate analysis of his surrounding (COGFUNC_MENTION and COGFUNC_MENTION), and he doesn't show traits of healthy or positive COGFUNC_MENTION - his impulsiveness and substance addictions indicate lower stack COGFUNC_MENTION or COGFUNC_MENTION. It's either an inability to take care of himself (inferior COGFUNC_MENTION) or an overindulgence in COGFUNC_MENTION (characteristics of TYPE_MENTION's and TYPE_MENTION's).He's just not considerate of others, he hates pretending and acting (COGFUNC_MENTION PolR), and he's totally self indulgent (COGFUNC_MENTION). I would guess he's an TYPE_MENTION, as he almost constantly comes to realizations that may be super detached from reality (COGFUNC_MENTION) like \\\"I should make amends to Penny!\\\" or he idealizes people kind of far from who they actually are. Thoughts?As for your other typing, I mostly agree. I'd say princess Carolyn is an TYPE_MENTION from her general better control of herself, and her desire to make emotionally uninvolved decisions and her constant identity crises (inferior COGFUNC_MENTION).|||damn these people are getting real mad at us saying that women are a varied group with different personalities, huh?|||Hey, thank you.

Capitalism doesn't necessarily reward inventive people unless they 1. own the means of production to produce their invention. or 2. produce an invention that lends itself to immediate profitability.On the contrary,  [many](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms5747), [many](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v425/n6960/full/nature02043.html), scientific studies show that humans demonstrate extraordinary cooperation skills and altruism. Selfishness is not automatically our base behavior. I think it is mostly the fault of capitalism rewarding of selfish, antisocial behavior that makes a belief system like that necessary to long-term survival and reproduction.Again, the studies above show that altruism and cooperation are tools we are skilled in.The two are antithetical. The closest to a compromise between the two is social democracy, where high taxes and strong social programs serve to dilute the wealth accumulation tendencies of capitalism and provide support for the poor.|||Nah, she's South Asian.

I was a dumb teenager mostly, but also I thought that it couldn't represent anyone except white women because of the way the only visible feminism on TV/mainstream media is white feminism, and women of color get the short end of the stick in a big way. I hated that feminism was exclusive, at least in my mind, even though in reality it was just me being too close minded to realize WOC were everywhere in the movement and that though they may not get the recognition for their help, they still do benefit from the advances feminism has made and will make. I remember a ton of white feminists from my high school were straight up racist, and taunted my sister for shitty things like her hair and call her names like \\\"lakwondawatermelondrafonda\\\" just to make fun of her. In the next breath talk about how shitty the patriarchy and how sexist jokes enforced patriarchy. So when I found out that there was a movement that excludes transwomen from feminism, I just felt super angry and had to get it off my chest somewhere and sounded exactly the same.|||Can I also take a look at your PS?

I can't do the in-between thing of just taking things as they go, and not putting to much stock into the people who I do care about.

An TYPE_MENTION (COGFUNC_MENTION-COGFUNC_MENTION-COGFUNC_MENTION-COGFUNC_MENTION) is actually way more similar to an TYPE_MENTION (COGFUNC_MENTION-COGFUNC_MENTION-COGFUNC_MENTION-COGFUNC_MENTION) than an TYPE_MENTION (COGFUNC_MENTION-COGFUNC_MENTION-COGFUNC_MENTION-COGFUNC_MENTION) is when you look at the cognitive functions.

There are so many more examples I can list, but I'm sure you recognize the pattern that identities are complex and one that is a victim of different structural biases can impose them on someone else. We must look at the world in a multifaceted way that includes class, of course, but also race, gender, ability status, sexuality, etc. or we will leave behind comrades and be violent in the same way. While many of the origins of their oppression might be capitalism and white supremacy, the solutions will have to come from many different places.Also, as /u/Korgull 's comment explains, Marx himself was not a supporter of class reductionist thought.I agree completely; they should include class in their analyses of society. Intersectionality is not about erasing class struggle, but about contextualizing it along other marginalized identities.I cannot link citations for my claims right now, as I am busy, but I can provide them later if you would like.|||Wow, I am so bad at seeing the cognitive functions in myself.

I thought I was an TYPE_MENTION for a while, although I was restless in that identity. Someone read through my comment history and told me i sounded more NTP-ish. I've never considered I might be an TYPE_MENTION before. TYPE_MENTION's have lowest stack COGFUNC_MENTION, meaning they'd probably repress it strongly. Does that mean that TYPE_MENTION's are more inconsiderate?I'm a little bit less funny and less expressive and more detached in this video than I am in real life. I'm called introspective often. I'd consider myself a pretty kind and sacrificing person, and I've gotten that from many friends before. I make friends pretty easily with a large variety of groups. I definitely need my alone time, though, and it bothers some people how much I can just be fine being alone for a while. It makes them think I don't care about them. I'm very quick on my feet for jokes and references and puns. I avoid debating because I don't like hurting people and even though it would be interesting, it's not worth the amount of discord it causes.

A piece of criticism you get often from others is that you act irrational under stress or when taking advice you may not necessarily want to hear from people.2. Creative, caring, and independent. You are extremely good at sensing the motivations of others, and you have a intuitive understanding of how people work. Although you are almost always playful and fun, you have a severely serious side that you show to very few people. You don't feel things in the presence of other people very often, but instead when you are alone where you feel safe to sort things out.|||Lol then your vet mug!

Orange County is known as a happy sheltered place for a reason, so most of my friends never had any experiences like that.|||That's unfortunate :/ I empathize with a lot of what you said. It sucks and there's no way to sugarcoat it. Have you been asking people out to coffees, or putting yourself on Tinder, okCupid, or other dating services?

May I ask why you don't drink? Religion, bad experiences, something else?Unfortunately, all that advice is useless if everything's not going fine with you internally.

I never said that. I feel sick imagining the guilt he feels about the pain he caused her. But I feel even more fucking sick about the violation she must feel right now. I know they love each other, you can easily see it in the way she writes about him in her post. She feels guilty even writing this post, and for feeling the way she does. Regardless of what love she feels, he wronged her, and she needs some space right now to heal and process things. \\\"Safe\\\" means somewhere she can process her emotions about this completely. I apologize if I didn't make that clear, and I think you are right. (I apologize, OP! If this made you alarmed, I apologize.) She can explain things to him once she is ready. I would agree that once she feels ready, she should talk to him, especially if she wants to continue dating him. I wouldn't consider it morally wrong if she doesn't talk to him about this though. I know the word \\\"trigger\\\" is hated on Reddit, but she might associate his face with those earlier experiences she had with non consent, as well as the violation she currently feels. If he does trigger negative emotions in her right now, she is completely justified in not wanting to see him again.Anyways, like I said, I don't think this guy is evil or any shit like that. This sort of rough play is hot for a lot of people, me included, but it needs to be discussed first in order to avoid situations like this.

Black people make up 12% of the population. There are more white people in poverty by numbers because they make up 63% of the United States population overall. Basically, if 6% of the overall population is poor Black people, then that means that 50% of Black people live in poverty. If 6% of the overall population is poor White people, then that means 9.5% of the White people live in poverty. This is why it's important to look at percentages separately from raw numbers, because they are confusing and not interchangeable.Poverty and crime are sort of a chicken and egg case. Sociologists, Criminologists, and many other social scientists are looking into this, and finding that even more complicatedly, what poor people do BECOMES a crime. When a poor person is charged with a crime, they are many times more likely to not recover from it financially than when a rich person commits a crime. Think of it like this -- who is going to be worse off after prison: Paula Deen or a person who can't afford to pay a parking ticket because they are late on last month's rent?|||That's a good point lol|||What is that, if you don't mind me asking?

I think he really wants the whole \\\"understand deeply and be understood deeply\\\" thing that COGFUNC_MENTION is more commonly associated with. He loves Dianne, Charlotte, and Wanda, because he feels personally and truly understood by them.|||How's that Dash Charging? And have you had any charging port issues yet?|||Of course not, but if we are talking about changing the way we talk in order to be gender inclusive that's not a bad question to ask.|||I hate that reddit won't ever take you on your points and just call you a SJW or tell you you're being too PC. Show me the studies that find that women are predisposed to being gossipy.|||Please carefully read what I'm saying, it's not opinion at all. All I said was that reddit is a majority white, do you disagree? and most white people can't understand structural and institutionalized racism, which is backed by studies. Have you ever conducted a study of your own in this field that you can show me that proves this wrong? These are the only things I have said. I literally never said white people ignorantly generalize. I said they can't understand racism, and that is just a fact proven by the study above.Nope, they are not perfectly preventable. The economic situation of African Americans is not a consequence of their laziness, but of overt and obvious and also, more subtle and dangerous restrictions on their economic development. Conditions in this country were intentionally made to benefit white Americans, and not to benefit Black Americans. Let me show you studies, and historical context that back up the fact that being Black in this country, regardless of attitude, I mean entirely regardless of attitude is a huge disadvantage:Income Inequality:Besides this having historical roots in slavery, which is tired and always repeated, the FHA greatly increased income inequality. In it's idea, of course it seemed a way to help the underprivileged in America, which was mostly comprised of minorities, but [\\\"the FHA explicitly refused to back loans to black people or even other people who lived near black people.\\\"](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/05/the-racist-housing-policy-that-made-your-neighborhood/371439/) This allowed white Americans to buy houses that appreciated well in value, but not Black Americans from buying these same houses that are highly valued today. This means that the White middle class was heavily subsidized into existence, whereas the Black middle class was never allowed to happen. Keep in mind that in 1934 there was very obvious other sources of racism to keep Black people down in America. Do you think that when the Civil Rights Act was passed in 1968, 34 years later, that things magically became better for Black Americans? Nope. We both know it didn't. The value that the properties that White people were pretty much given had so skyrocketed that in 1983, 15 years after the Civil Rights Act, White equity was 10 times that of Black equity in the country. [The average Black FAMILY was worth $10,000, and the average white family was worth $100,000. Even 15 years after the law had passed](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;es_th=1&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=wealth%20gap%20white%20black&amp;es_th=1). 1983 really wasn't that long ago, but somehow the situation was actually improving. The gap was slightly but steadily closing. Then the banks had the wonderful idea that predatory loans on the impoverished, which we both have to agree because of the facts above were primarily African American, and many Black families lost their houses, and income inequality became worse than ever. In 2013, after the Great Recession that primarily hurt minorities, the average white households were worth 13 times the average Black households. Yep. Even more recently than you would think, 13 times. Income inequality today between the races is worse than in 1983. Directly due to banks hurting Black communities. Now I know what you're thinking. \\\"White communities were hurt by the recession too! Everyone was hurt!\\\" And I get that sentiment. My dad last his job in the recession. He was jobless for a while, and money was very tight in our household. I understand how it is to hurt financially. But White people were not hurt NEARLY as bad a black communities. Watch [this short video](http://money.cnn.com/2014/12/12/news/economy/wealth-by-race-pew/) that is sourced. [Black unemployment was also much worse during the same Great Recession.](http://thinkprogress.org/education/2014/06/25/3452887/education-race-gap/) Income inequality today is not the result of Black people being lazy. It never has been. Educational InequalityWhile this gap is closing, it is very obvious and easy to understand why the income inequality explained above prevents many African Americans from going to college which is basically a requirement in this economy to be a member of the middle class. I know, there are many jobs that don't require college degrees that make money, but the majority of work today that can even land you in the middle class is held by people with degrees. Obvious historical bans on African Americans going to Predominately White Universities, and the delegitimizing of HBCU's, have also contributed greatly. Pay Gap[Did you know that with the same application, a white felon is more likely to land a job than a black person who has never gone to jail?](http://ac360.blogs.cnn.com/2008/08/09/study-black-man-and-white-felon-same-chances-for-hire/) [Or that a Black college graduate has the same chances of getting a job as a white high school drop out for the same application?](http://thinkprogress.org/education/2014/06/25/3452887/education-race-gap/) Obviously these all tie in together, so I'll let this one be shorter, but let's assume you get past income inequality and can somehow afford college. [Even for the same job, African Americans are paid less just for their skin color in high skilled professions.](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;es_th=1&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=pay+gap+race+same+job)I don't know if you are white, but if you are, I'm not personally blaming you for this. You didn't have anything to do with these institutional disadvantages for Black people. You worked hard. You went to school. You made your dreams possible. I understand that it feels like a personal attack, but it really isn't. You probably never learned of this stuff in school. However, saying that Black people are economically hurting mostly because they refuse to get of their lazy butts and stop blaming whitey isn't factually supported, it's intellectually dishonest, and this mentality dehumanizes Black people and does nothing to support income equality between the races.TL;DR: Racism isn't imaginary. Black people have been consistently held back in this country, and were again most recently by the 2007 economic crash. Income Inequality causes many obvious issues.|||So, like \\\"Open File\\\" versus \\\"Save File?\\\" I have zero understanding of COGFUNC_MENTION. It's just so foreign to me.

Would an COGFUNC_MENTION dom/aux be inside their head often, analyzing the implications of their sensory information? Or do they process it the same time as they are receiving it? I know there is a huge bias towards intuition on reddit, and that many people think they are the exception, but I do think that I am an Intuitive. I am in my head too often and not present enough to be an S. I often ignore my physical needs, and I have terrible spatial awareness. I cannot maintain a schedule of any sort, and I find it hard to focus when doing repetitive tasks. I find it hard to stop my brain from running away with sentences that I hear in conversation, so I end up having two conversations at once when I'm talking to people because of this; one to myself, fully developing the implications of a thing someone said and the other, of course, with the person I am talking too. My TYPE_MENTION mom often criticizes how much I'm in my head. These all sound like they eliminate the possibility of COGFUNC_MENTION or COGFUNC_MENTION being high in my stack to me, but I'm sure many S types break the stereotypes I said above.|||That's what I'm talking about! :)|||Wouldn't perceiving dominant types struggle more with indecision and waiting too long to make a decision, and judging dominant types rush in to make a decision?|||Thank you for your advice.

I just didn't see that the first and second sentence were meant to be said together.|||Be yourself, around anyone. I know it sounds like useless advice to just be yourself, but seriously, you are well equipped as an TYPE_MENTION to connect to just about anyone. Don't be afraid to use your COGFUNC_MENTION. Be vulnerable and honest with people, especially when you are validating their feelings. Don't be afraid to be the first person to open up. Just don't be afraid in general, TYPE_MENTION's are wonderful when they are uninhibited.In my experience with TYPE_MENTION's, those who use vulnerability to open up and make real connections receive one of three reactions in people. They react with genuine love most of the time. They react with emotional inadequacy sometimes. And they may react with scorn, but this is rare. The odds are heavily in your favor. A lot of the time, people who don't connect with you will feel bummed that they couldn't. It's real. I've seen it happen.Find it in yourself to make a personal connection to them and open up your mind to the different types of people out there who think differently than you. You can always learn something from them. Unless they're just assholes. In that case, fuck them. Don't waste your time.|||Thank you! I was going to 'wisp the conkeldurr but I was afraid that conkeldurr would have guts and I would have set it up to sweep.

I hate that I can't put down my 50 layers of self-defense. I hate that I get addicted to things to easily. I hate that I chameleon so well sometimes I don't know if I have a personality.

Killing someone, and theft, on the other hand definitely have their morally acceptable time and place. Of course, this does not defeat universal morality, as only one thing has to be consistently immoral for the concept to have merit.I like the distinction you made between the positive and the negative forms of morality (\\\"being good to one another\\\" vs \\\"knowing not to do certain things\\\").

I think IxFJ fits you well, but I don't know for sure. I think I slightly prefer IxFJ because the lack of COGFUNC_MENTION in your post. When the car broke down, you didn't want to jump in and solve the problem or take stock of your resources or blah blah blah save the day. You wanted to comfort people around you. That shows most often auxiliary or dominant COGFUNC_MENTION.I'm do not think you are an TYPE_MENTION or an TYPE_MENTION. Both would refer to specific events similar to the questions asked as a reference point. Like \\\"Well, I had something similar happen to me, and I did this.\\\" Plus, I don't get any sense of repressed COGFUNC_MENTION from you. Repressed COGFUNC_MENTION would look like freaking out all the possible negative outcomes from the car breaking down, or so many other things from your post. I don't know how tertiary COGFUNC_MENTION tends to manifest itself, but I don't see enough COGFUNC_MENTION to type you as an TYPE_MENTION either.

No, they clearly do not just attribute everything evolved in humans to altruism. They specifically attribute it to cooperation. They aren't doing a historical review of human nature, lol. Why would they talk about slavery or other coercion at all? The study is about human cooperation as compared to other primates. They specifically study \\\"allomaternal care\\\" which means care done for offspring not by the birth mother and \\\"proactive prosociality,\\\" or unsolicited pro-social behaviors. They positively correlated strong levels of allomaternal care with pro-social behaviors and showed human being represent high levels of allomaternal care when compared to other primates. It then establishes that humans don't break the primate ratios. My point isn't that this study alone proves that communism is the only viable form of rule, lol. It is that the often cited \\\" muh human nature\\\" response to socialism and communism are not adequate responses.For the second study, my bad. I accessed it off my university's journal service. Reading more into the cited sources for the first article will give you the same experience. Some of the articles cited even posit self-regard to preclude altruism.Is it really that ridiculous to think that human beings have natural tendencies towards certain behaviors that they sometimes override in order to survive?

The usual signs don't always manifest themselves normally in TYPE_MENTION's.Look to body language as clues. This is general advice, but it applies pretty strongly to TYPE_MENTION's, in my experience. Are they looking at you when you start to speak in group settings? Do they focus on you and your reactions in group settings? Do they pull you aside for one on one conversations? Do they look at your lips a lot when they talk? How comfortable are they standing close to you / making small occasional physical contact with you? Do you ever catch them staring? All of those are potential good signs. You will pick up more as you age and meet people. If someone has somehow physically signaled to you that they are interested, all that's left, of course, is for you to make a move in an appropriate way. No dick pics, unwarranted physical contact, \\\"stealing\\\" kisses, etc. Clear communication and permission should always be established when making a move on someone.

A lot of them are for URM students specifically and you may find one that works with undocumented students. They are targeted towards getting you into great schools and solid relationships with professors at different universities. Also, look into ways you can combine Life Science and Engineering (Computational Fluid Dynamics for Cardiovascular applications or Electronic Prosthetic Control Systems, for example) if those other resources are more geared towards that and look into doubling with mechanical and aerospace so that you aren't only locked into the aerospace industry, which as you note is notoriously difficult for noncitizens to get into.

Pretty much the same way slaveholders did to alienate white people in poverty from black slaves in the United States. They've oppressed the Oromo for so long that it was just a matter of time before the situation we see at hand began to unfold.

Some things I would look into are:* Where are the curriculum options the best for my goals? (i.e. where can I double major in something related to genetics, tissue engineering and neurobiology? Where does the bioengineering curriculum have the most organic chemistry, biomaterials, tissue engineering, and neuorbiology curriculum?, Which curriculum is ABET certified / prepares me for medical school requirements / meets the requirements of graduate schools? etc.)* What schools produce the most interesting research in neural tissue engineering and biomaterials? Where are the experts in these fields? Does this school facilitate undergraduates participation in research?* Location, location, location. If your school is near companies, or hospitals, or in a big college town with a lot of hospitals and research collaborations possible, those things will help.I know these aren't specific programs to look at, but it really does unfortunately depend on your specific situation.|||fam why you reading some PUA bullshit. love yourself, lol|||Betam des yilengal.

Some people see his S traits as just that but I realize that the motivations behind it are very intuitive.|||From an ENTPOther TYPE_MENTION: Many who know they are TYPE_MENTION become narcissistic and enjoy knowing they have the most powerful gift a troll could possess and use it for trolling. Wasted potential. If these TYPE_MENTION's were to fix their act you'd probably see TYPE_MENTION's rise from 3rd most desired personality type to 1st. Others actually do good things with this combination of traits and can be the most expansive personalities, a true jack of all trades with mastery in a few main interest areas. NT with P is a free flow of thoughts and connection and E allows the TYPE_MENTION to express it out in so many areas pretty much connecting the meaning of everything life has to offer them. My experience with TYPE_MENTION's, can have some of the widest perspectives on many things like myself, and are actively working on many things at once like myself. Might be TYPE_MENTION narcicism but it's a very powerful personality that has the potential to be either the greatest or the worst in society. Having the ability to see 20 possibilities before they happen on an unonscious level is a perspective that should not be underestimated. By far the most creative thinkers.TYPE_MENTION: My brother from another mother. They pretty much are what an TYPE_MENTION would be with more time introspecting and pursuing more researching and less active stuff. TYPE_MENTION's are smarter but less globally skilled with the type of experience set the TYPE_MENTION otherwise acquires. TYPE_MENTION's have a better check against overwhelming others due to more reservation, on average are more socially well adjusted.TYPE_MENTION: To start, NTJ is a different think tank from NTP. More structure is more efficient for completing things and can often have more depth than us NTP's but lack the same globally broad base of knowledge. This is perhaps why the NTP's are the highest IQ's while NTJ's on average more accomplished. The TYPE_MENTION I like a lot. I never have any clash, just sometimes slow to know an introvert. My experience we work together really well and we each have a respect for what the other can do, but I can't help to feel that I am judged however it hasn't lead to problems.TYPE_MENTION: Like the TYPE_MENTION but the extroversion causes them to scrutinize something they do not understand, and the J structure closes the open mindedness their TYPE_MENTION counterpart has. TYPE_MENTION and TYPE_MENTION are both leader like take charge types socially and there is just this closed minded and open minded clash as a result. Not all TYPE_MENTION's are bad experiences, it just seems like when they are they just have a mental block from seeing something different. This irritates the free thinker that is an TYPE_MENTION like me, it's a clash against my own philosohpy of life. Other than this, TYPE_MENTION's have something an TYPE_MENTION wants. It's powerful to take the completionist mindset the NTJ has and give it extroverted energy.Best way to put it. TYPE_MENTION is like my identical twin brother. Dr. Evil if separated at birth, or a clone of myself if raised together. TYPE_MENTION is my brother from another mother. TYPE_MENTION is good as a best friend, we got some differences the other does not have and the ability to work together which is a powerful combo. The TYPE_MENTION is my rival. We're very similar and each got something the other could really benefit from but we do not work well together too often. For the record, I've been good friends with an TYPE_MENTION before. Just depends how far apart the two are on P vs. J I think. I don't think TYPE_MENTION's and TYPE_MENTION's get along when they are both very strong on the ExxP and ExxJ.|||That's the big feature Bumble advertises.

I would usually initiate, she would just show all the signs of being open to me and never failing to keep a conversation going.

Not to mention I have 2 dupes on my Vegito so it has become a very valuable roster fillerBeyond those, I do not have any other AGL players with good links. I could throw in a GT SSJ3 Goku as either STR or AGL, and a GT STR Trunks has good links for all of these players. After this I lack the team cost for anything else so I would run an un-awakened Jaco or some other fillers.My only other idea is the run SSJ4 Goku, Gogeta, use an SSJ4 Goku friend, and use the rest of my team dedicated to stunning and supporting them to do all the heavy hitting.What should I do?|||Thank you.

I registered for Perk with a facebook that exist only for dating apps, and other apps. It had no email which was OK on perk registration but a problem with Viggle. I later added an email to this facebook but it would not let me register with that facebook because it was already registered but stuck in the process. I I make a viggle by email alone, it may be considered another account and risking a ban. Actually I think I did register a viggle before I clearly knew that the 2 services were merged. I am sort of at mercy to be banned, and using viggle may just bring that to surface.edit: I figured what do I have to lose if the service is crapping out everywhere on me. Seems like it finally let me use facebook login on viggle, only problem I have is a random viggle account that never even earned one point.

Myy COGFUNC_MENTION is super charged on the cognitive functions test. I didn't go by MBTI but over the last year I've been a loner and I had pretty much used my COGFUNC_MENTION to understand my COGFUNC_MENTION in MBTI speak. I did what is considered impossible for most thinking dominant types it seems because I managed to logically understand feelings enough to slap meaning on it and quite possibly upped my EQ through introspection.

I do admire some people for various reasons though but look up to is too holistic for me to say.Tyrion Lannister in Game Of Thrones is probably someone I would look up to IRL, but if he was in real life I wouldn't know enough about him like the character presented in a series. Go figure, he is a total TYPE_MENTION|||What is the correct terminology for this feature so I can actually locate the correct extensions?|||TYPE_MENTION is the most desired, TYPE_MENTION is second. It was a survey asking people which type they found most sexually attractive. This did not factor between men and women however. TYPE_MENTION makes sense when the question is sexually attractive. An NF who is P and unstructured rather than J would create that spontaneous irrational but deep connection type of love story with goofy moments, E has the energy for it. TYPE_MENTION was a surprising one for second considering that however. It seems like mystery is attractive. I wonder how the results would change with the question being for a partner rather than sexually attractive?TYPE_MENTION comes with a bad rap due to some of them but being 3rd of all types on average despite the bad bunch is quite impressive to say how much some people must like the more rounded ones|||I looked into pay for delete.

I won't be able to despair over the fact.If I could be immortal, I could become bored. I would become a prisoner to my own mind in the long haul if I continue accumulating knowledge. The existential mindfuck is too much. I already share many of the high IQ problems that geniuses suffer from. The more I learn and integrate in my web of experience and insight, the more of an alien I become in this world and the better I have to get at dumbing myself down in order to it in and even communicate effectively with the average closed minded zombie. I'm not suicidal at all, but damn would that be so easy. Eventually, I will be ready for death. It doesn't scare me, it's just the eventually needed liberation from existence.|||Go figure, the reason I dug this stuff out was specifically for the purpose of mining.I can see how that problem would happen. For instance with this old computer being HP it has a weak PSU that probably would not cover the PCIe power draw from the video card. I would sort the componants from the 2 PSU's accordingly although quite honestly using an 7 year old 620 watt PSU just to power the motherboard and a single video card may be below the ideal efficiency range of that PSU, and the same with the cheap HP PSU used for only the CPU and HDD. I'm not sure if this is worth the wall power draw and buying a single video card.I'm curious to just verify this PSU is fully functional at least. It was last time it was used.|||I had an TYPE_MENTION friend, we got along very well. He was a very obvious TYPE_MENTION.

I control my future, not them. With enough mental method acting I can trick the test too if it's designed to weed out inconsistency. More common with MMPI rather than MBTI which is really simple.My employer and a piece of paper doesn't control my future. I control my future.|||It's based on the job, and knowing what the types are regarded as good for. Amazon basically discriminates their applications down to a single type. Either TYPE_MENTION or TYPE_MENTION I would just shift myself down to an TYPE_MENTION depending on the line of work and I am quite commordbid to both those types anyway so it wouldn't be a misrepresentation of me at all given the line of work. I could also adjust myself to be J easily. Your answers are affected by the mood and recent events when you take the test anyway. I can just think back to a period of my life I was pretty much playing the TYPE_MENTION role and done, I just tricked the test into typing as an TYPE_MENTION or INTJMBTI is not perfect anyway. Two people could be the same type but swing in opposite directions on some questions anyway. To me, manipulating my type is not a big lie rather than another side of me. Now me adjusting my answers to be an S or F would be doable in the test but would be a horrible representation for job consideration.|||TYPE_MENTION's are idea people who see possibilities. So hitting an absolute conclusion is not simple unless you can close all loops. Easiest way to beat me in debate is to find a middle ground which happens when we both really challenge the critical thinking, or to find something I am missing and change the playing field completely. The latter I am not as used to happening to me which impresses me if you can find something that is a bigger picture than what I was on about.|||Ok so focus is a better word for it.

It depends on the person but some people are better off just getting jobs that the are not particularly interested in and developing into it while others are better at doing what they love for a living.There was a study I read in full text about fit vs. develop theory for careers. Career satisfaction after enough years was equal among both samples except with the develop crowd often making more money since they sought out higher paying jobs.Fit theorist = you find a job you already fit into.Develop theorist = you will learn to understand the job and appreciate it.-The job being difficult and stressful is a negative factor towards both theories of career satisfaction.My best advice. Know your limits and whether or not you think this job will stress your cognitive facilities.

Dash is just a big go to name to compare and contrast against imo. At that, Zencash has a node system soon to come out that runs on only 42 Zen to hold. This would allow nodes to form up around the world rather than just in richer nations.Decred is the governance king. Unlike Dash where you trust the developers to honor the community vote, Decred has their updates on the blockchain waiting for user votes to activate it. Decred's ticket based voting system is also locks a stakers funds during the voting process unliek a Dash masternode where you can sell off in an instant so voters are more inclined to vote for what is in favor of the coins future rather than sabotage and sell off to their hedge.And no, Decred doesn't have a huge premine. It's a very modest one airdropped and allocated to development. ZCash has a by far huger pseudo premine with their 20% founder reward and ICO's are the biggest examples.

While Dash isn't trustless since the devs are counted on to actually honor the consensus gathered by the votes, Decred is trustless since the votes passing locks in the update that is already on the blockchain waiting to be activated. I can't speak for the other coins mentioned here about being trustless or not.No coin is without any form of governance. Bitcoin runs on a governance model that severely fails to reach consensus.  These coins have a governance model that is able to reach a more effective consensus in relatively decentralized matter. Far more decentralized than a single mining farm with more than 5% of the BTC network hash deciding to resist an update that everyone else is signaling for.  So your argument to me is we need coins to be decentralized and trustless. I don't see how I failed to hit both those points with Decred at least. Also, you haven't given me a single example of a decentralized and trustless coin yourself that somehow doesn't have governance. Instead of name calling, try to provide some actual substance to back your argument.|||The class on Monday/Wednesday is basically remedial.

But how is someone an idiot for still being \\\"on the center\\\"?

But there is more. *You* need to get therapy. Realize that being with someone like her will be giving everything you have emotionally and mentally because you love her, and getting very little in return because she simply can't in her condition. This asks for tremendous personal sacrifice which **will** take a toll on you. You need to beat this by starting out with individual therapy for you straight away just like she. If you don't you'll find yourself in a *very* dark place and not only will you not be able to help her anymore, you will probably also spend a very long time on breing able to do nothing else but get better yourself. If that happens, this will cost you your friends and career. Last, you'll need couples therapy as well, maybe not as intensive as individual therapy, but both you have do not have any strong, good experience of what it means to be in a good relationship, and frankly, you two will not be in the position to figure it out on your own and make mistakes because remember, she's I'll and her recovery takes priority over learning new skills.I'm not saying what you want is impossible, I'm doing it myself right now, but you should be aware of what you'll put yourself through and take proper precautions to keep yourself mentally healthy.|||Media is also telling men that you are worthless if you don't have a body fit for a god and I don't see all the men on this sub hitting the gyms daily either.

He also thinks of himself as adequate but.. I guess.. not on par with myself. I don't know, I disagree of course  and it really hurt *me* knowing he sees himself like that. For example, he thinks I am the smart one, because I'm doing multiple majors without much effort and he's having trouble getting good grades for his single major. However, I see him as far more intelligent, because he is totally passionate about his studies and soaks up everything but sucks at making traditional tests, while I just know really well how to game the system and perform well at traditional testing but know far less then he does. What you say about your boyfriend jumping headfirst into things and for some reason succeeding at everything is also something I recognize in how my boyfriend looks at me. The thing is: I fuck up *all the fucking time*, but simply manage to hide it and still come out on top because I get the game I'm playing and that's just how I roll. This gives me a set of interpersonal skills which society really values, but I thing my hard skills are a bit overrated by people who know me, including my boyfriend. My boyfriend however, lacks a bit of these interpersonal skills, but his hard skills are way up there. What I'm saying: the fact that your boyfriend is with you means he loves you and thinks you are incredible and an equal partner to him. If he didn't think this about you, he wouldn't be with you. He's clearly seeing things in you you don't see in yourself. If this is striking a cord with you: know that your boyfriend doesn't think of you as the lesser partner. He might even think you're the better partner! Only you consider yourself the lesser partner.You should ask him about it. Ask him to verbalize why he thinks you are lovable and incredible. His answers may surprise you. Also, try to love yourself more. If *another* person finds reason to love you, you should be able to find reasons to love yourself.|||Edit: sorry, I switched around the genders of bio and step parent!Hey, I'm also an only child, 22 now and I have a 1 year old little halfbrother. When I was your age, this was one of my biggest fears exactly for the reasons you stated (also the competitiveness you are expressing in your comments, I get it..)The thing is.. at 18 you'll move out, and all those cozy little nuclear family things you are experiencing will be gone. You'll live your own life, maybe go to your dad's house once a month and you'll be calling your dad for advice on all kinds of practical grown up stuff. But the daily 'how was your day' conversations will fade.. and that's ok. Notice how I said 'your dad's house'? That's because in a few years you'll find yourself a new home, and the house you grew up with will less and less be your home.I would have been miserable with a baby in the house. It would have made me beyond sad as due to the divorce I had trouble feeling safe and secure in my home to begin with. That child would have made those feelings worse. If I were in your shoes, based on my experience now, I would be open with your dad and stepmum about your feelings. Considering they care so much, I would ask them to wait another year or two so you'll be able to move out by the time the baby comes around. About your competitiveness (I am so going to be downvoted to hell for this, but I honestly feel like this..) I found one thought incredibly soothing. My dad is older than yours. He's early 50s now. I felt incredibly angry that this kid would grow up with all the opportunities of a stable nuclear family, while frankly, my parents fucked me up pretty good and I'm fighting to become the best I can be *despite* my parents. But then I realized how  I still have it so much better than my baby brother, because I'll have my parents (even if they are a bit flawed) around to guide and support me until into my 50s, while my baby brother will most likely have to bury his dad before he's 30. Maybe something you don't understand yet, but it is only now in my 20s I actually get to know my parents, because the parent-child relationship is shifting to an adult-adult relationship. I'll have half a lifetime to truly get to know my parents and make then proud of the adult I've become. I will be celebrating *so* many of my adult successes with my parents. My baby brother will only have 10 years or so to do this. There is *so* much up side in being the eldest, very early born child, which is and advantage any baby - even if your dad will have 5 more - can never take away from you.|||So your husband is a Dutch national. I get residency is an issue, but I reckon you should be allowed to travel all across Europe together with your husband under EU directive 2004/38/EC. This directive might not allow you to get residency in the Netherlands because your husband is Dutch (you would be allowed residency elsewhere in the EU together with your husband based on this directive by the way), but it should *definitely* allow you to travel through all of Schengen legally.|||Oh shit, it totally missed this. OP should disregard my comment in that case!|||I like your username. :P|||The US has a far bigger problem that maternity and paternity leave. The problem is leave and vacation in general. Every time this topic comes up anywhere it quickly derails into feelings of jealously, \\\"why should someone get extra leave just for popping out a child\\\", \\\"why can't I get leave for caring for my sick mother\\\". It is honestly *ridiculous* that the US does not have any statutory leave. This has nothing to do with egalitarianism, and everything to do with simply social minimum welfare one can expect from a developed country. That's the true issue. That being said, I found the article to be rather weak. The points stated have nothing to do with how hard 'paternity' leave is. Frankly, the points he made are simply called 'parenting' and you'll be doing it for another 20 years, just like humankind has been doing for many many millions of years already. In today's world, having children is a lifestyle choice, not a necessity. Yes, parenting is hard, that's a given and was to be expected. No need for the martyrdom.|||How long will you be staying with your parents? If you're staying a long time, maybe you can consider paying your parents some towards grocery and utilities? I didn't see those in your list, but those costs won't cease to exist... essentially your parents will be funding your savings, at the expense of their own savings. Maybe they don't even want or need you money, but it would be a nice gesture and they might appreciate it.|||Yes, being tiny and surround by bigger markets means (knowledge) export is your biggest trade. This has been the case for *centuries* in our country. Language education is made mandatory by our government because it's so important for the Netherlands on a societal/economic scale.|||The Netherlands is amazing, but not the right country for everyone. In r/IWantOut there was a guy who wanted to come the NL to study and live here and he asked what he should study to get a good job that paid 6 figures. That's beyond unrealistic as the Netherlands is a very much focused on equality in terms of socioeconomic ability. For example our minister president earns about 230k which is outrageously high really. A very telling statement about the Dutch is: 'just be normal and you'll already be weird enough'. The Netherlands is amazing if you want to have the perfect, comfortable average life, in that case, everything will be arranged for you by the government, but there are very few possibilities if you want to actually achieve something and do something great with your life.|||When I read your title, I thought: 'Definitely!' considering that I am a HSP. However, when I read the rest of your post, I was thinking maybe we have different definitions of HSP. For me HSP is being hypersensitive to external stimuli: sounds, sights, physical sensation etc, it's also called sensory processing sensitivity.This does not necessarily have to do anything with EQ, for example, I have trouble walking through a busy shopping street without wearing headphones, as it will make me extremely tired from overstimulation. Same for things like alcohol and caffeine, which seem to hit me a lot harder (mentally in terms of the crash after the high) than others. When it comes to EQ, I do think I have a higher EQ than the general population, but I don't think my HSP helps with that. In any case: it probably hinders me, because dealing with high emotions in people around me (**not** my own emotions, which I deal with absolutely fine) also gets to me mentally because of being HSP. Right now for example, I am travelling with a group of people who are very diverse in personalities and energy levels.. at about 3 o clock I had to tell the group I was going back to the hotel because it was all simply too much I was about to collapse under the tiredness and exhaustion.|||Ok, I get what you mean now.

I passed HSK1 some time ago, planning to pass HSK2 some time after summer and hope to pass HSK3 next summer or so. What you said about comprehension did make me think of something.. I understand quite a few European languages reasonably well and often if a student gets stressed or frustrated and I understand their native language, I just ask them to explain in to me in their own language. I'll reply in English mostly, depending on the language, but it does help those students get their point across and often makes them feel a lot better.It might help the Chinese students as well if they'd be able to speak in their own language, considering what you said about being stressed out because of the foreign environment and everything else that's going on.|||I think /u/silentdragon95 who I replied to originally has a point about trust in sexual relationships. I thoroughly discuss sexual histories with my sexual partners and am not the person to have one night stands. What use will it have to do a test if I know the is no history of any STD and I know my body best and I show zero symptoms? I'm also vaccinated against HPV, the STD that's probably most difficult to catch because of vague symptoms. Come to think of it, I've never even met a OB/Gyn or had a pap smear in my life.. it's simply not that common for young women here to do so.Edit: that being said, it's important to know getting tested in free of charge in this country. You don't even have to ask for it at your GP, you can just visit one of the government regulated clinics to get your test free of charge from a doctor you don't know if you don't want your own GP to know about it for whatever reason. But no 'campus clinics' or standardized STD testing and that kind of stuff I hear many US people talk about.|||Je hebt er nu direct bijzonder weinig aan maar ga nu alvast nadenken welke vakken je volgend jaar zou kunnen/willen assisteren. Als 3de jaar kun je prima 1ste jaar vakken geven. Studentassistentschappen verdienen heel goed en het is goede en relevante werkervaring. Ze nemen alleen vaak geen 6jes studenten aan. Een 9 is ook niet nodig, maar een goede 7.5 is wel zo handig. Als je je eerste jaar nogal verkloot hebt dan kun je alsnog door nu beter te presteren op vervolgvakken prima in aanmerking komen voor een assistentschap|||This is my main question as well. I actually want to get into shooting as a sport in my very anti-gun country, so I get the attraction to guns.. but I honestly don't understand why you'd feel the need to actually carry one. Is it to look 'cool' and making a statement about gun ownership? Cause that's just lame.|||Practically all STEM masters take two years, while most social sciences/humanities take one year.|||Most people on this sub wouldn't like it, but still: the BBC has an amazing series called 'Call the Midwife'. It's about a group of midwife's in the 50s in a rather poor area of London. It deals with a lot of really important issues, most importantly to me: how the lack of (hormonal, reliable) birth control in that time affected societal norms for women and the societal view on family and children.It also deals with topics like legalization of abortion, societal becoming less religious, the development of how people would go to hospitals to give birth (and get other medical treatments) instead of giving birth at home. Lots of things.The thing is.. I'm a 90s kid. This was the time when my grandparents were adults. This was their reality. And my parents (baby boom) were the first to deal with all these societal changes, but were raised by the generation for whom those changes felt so foreign. That BBC series was honestly eye opening for me. The world changes beyond recognition in the past 100 years or so, that's only about 1 lifetime! We are still as a society very much searching of what these developments mean for us and how all our values and ideals need to be revaluated. I believe this change of how society views raising children is part of that.|||Overall, looking back at your relationship of the past 10 years? Would you say it is a good, happy relationship? I have a sort of general rule for myself when it comes to relationship troubles. Relationships will always have ups and downs, but if the down is most dominant for about the last 10% of the total length of your relationship (in your case the last year or so) you should strongly reconsider your relationship. If not, for example in the case of down periods that are generally short but may pop up often, I think you owe it to yourself and your partner to try and work on your relationship.If that's the case, you need to talk to your wife and tell her that you are at the brink of calling it quits but that you want to work on your relationship and that this will mean two things: 1. the marriage is from that moment onwards closed again, and she needs to stop seeing Lee. Period.2. the two of you go to marriage counseling starting as soon as possible.|||As a woman: you should have just *told* her.|||I grew up thinking I'd live the Life Script. Go to uni, find someone to marry, get a kid, work on a career. But during my teens I would start thinking about wanting to travel a lot for my work, living the expat life. And that I really just wanted one kid, but this kid should be intelligent and adaptable as well to be able to life the expat life I wanted. This went on for a long time, adding more and more boundary conditions to the Life Script. Then at 18 I met my SO, who didn't want children and he simply asked me why do you want children at all? And I figures I couldn't answer that question.. now I think I don't want children at all. I think, if you want children, that's fine, but if you do you need to put that kid on absolute priority number one. And if you want a kid, you cant put boundary conditions on what kind of kid it is going to be. You need to be just as happy with a highly ambitious and intelligent kid, as with a less intelligent kid with possibly bahavioural issues. And that's simply not the case for me. So I made the decision not to have children, I wouldn't put that child before my own (some would say selfish) priorities and I wouldn't make a good parent to a kid that turns out less ideal then I ideally want the kid to be. On top of that, overpopulation and man made environmental pollution are real issues, and I truly feel that anyone who doesn't absolutely want children shouldn't do so to help our environment recover. Now I'm in my 20s and planning an amazing career with my SO. We will be  living all over the world, not staying in a single country longer than a few years before moving to a new place. I am really happy now that I've settled my mind on this issue. It gives a lot of peace of mind.|||This is actually a really interesting point. I frequent /r/childfree and one of the main annoyances of the people of there is how they loose their friends when the friends become parents. Mostly because when people become parents the number one topic to talk about is children, which childfree people are usually not really interested in. Thing is: nothing really stops you from seeing your friends once you have children. Or more specifically, if your friends had children, how would that fact suddenly change why you will or won't be lonely? I mean, once you have children the reasons or the ability of your friends to visit you will not change. Child or not, your friend needs to get in a car and make time to meet you.|||From my own experience (so totally anecdotal), at those younger ages, it was my mother, a couple of aunts and uncles and a teacher who would push me away from STEM, while my dad was incredibly supportive of it. I clung on to my dad, who taught me to stand up for my self and be proud of my interests. It's not black and white, but more like a tug of war, and such events could have helped me and my dad by getting me in touch with girls with similar interests so I would have an easier time knowing I was indeed not the weird one of the bunch. I by the way agree that we will never reach a 50/50 split in most professions, and that's ok with me. But right now, you see that in many cases there is a 10/90 split in disciplines such as engineering and nursing. This will never be 50/50 but I do believe we are missing out on talent. Even if it's just a few male engineers who'd rather get into nursing and a few female nurses who want to get into engineering, but decided otherwise due to social pressure etc. I think that's my bottom line: even if the percentages don't change, getting rid of the social pressure on men and women is still a valuable thing to society.|||That would work if OP and SO are willing to live in *any* other EU country besides the UK, as through just simple marriage, OP would fall under freedom of movement when together with SO... However, they want to go to SO's home country so the UK is allowed to put additional requirements for OPs visa... Which she mentioned in her opening post and includes a hard income minimum the SO doesn't meet.|||I agree on this second point. Maybe even mail the CEO of this company seeing that it's a small one. Just tell them you won't be pursuing any action but like to bring some things to his/her attention as you were very dissapointed with how you were treated by employee X and give all the examples you havr given us. Don't apologize for your mail or anything, just be dissapointed in how everything was handled by his or her company.|||I like small groups. Maybe 2-4 people? No more than five. That way, you can actually still talk to one another and actually have a conversation. The reason why I like groups is because I notice *many* types let their behaviour depend on their environment and the people around them. If I'm socializing with people and I want to convince them to do a certain project or make a certain decision, it can be very relevant to consider their influence sphere. Someone may be very interested in a certain project one on one, but then they go back to their people, which show less enthusiasm and everything collapses. In that case, I need the person who I want to do something + the main influencers of that person together, and I'll focus to convince them as a group, not as an individual.... Fuck. Writing this down made me realize I have a hidden agenda even when I'm drinking beer.|||Although, yes, good programmes *are* selective, the selection process is by far less intimidating compared to the US. In Europe, doing a masters degree after a bachelor is more or less the minimum expectation of many employers, instead of a thought through career choice as it usually is in the US. Because of this, almost everyone who has done a bachelors degree reasonably well, will find themselves a spot in a masters programme. The selection they usually put in place is only to cut of the bottom percentages, but not to select only the top percentages. (Of course, not including OxBridge etc).What would be the average GPA of your fellow students? Is your university somewhere top 150 (or even top 100) in the world ranking? In my experience, in the case of US universities, the quality of the university determines a lot of your chances, as there simply is a far broader range of quality and depth to them. In Europe, most governments govern education quality extremely strict, so any university in a specific country will not differ much in quality from the other. I've had family members for example go to US colleges and return home only to find out their diplomas couldn't be converted to university level Dutch diploma's, but only 'applied science' diplomas. This is because according to the government, the education quality of those specific unis/colleges did not line up with the quality the government expects from our unis.|||This album actually captures the 'European' university student look pretty well.|||Besides the whole issue being silly, you could try the argument of why *I* need a tv or music on the background. For me to get my 'hyper focus' going, I need a stupid TV or music I'm not paying attention to to act as a white noise that cancels out all other irregular noises (car alarm, people talking on the hall way, etc.) for the same reasons why you need silence. I don't mind studying in the same room where my SO is gaming or doing the dishes, because I don't notice him over my white noise. If your boyfriend is the same, you could tell him that you like studying in silence for the same reason why he likes studying with back ground noise.|||Yep, especially for engineerings.. I think 90% or so gets their masters, those 10% who don't do so because a University degree simply turned out to be too difficult for them or because of personal reasons. Really the only exception to this rule is CompSci for which the demand is so astronomically big that companies have good offers ready for bachelor students and will further train them in house. If you're thinking of doing ChemEng in the Netherlands I highly recommend getting your masters degree over here as well. It's two years, tuition fees are about 14k a year for students outside of the US, there are several options: the technical universities but also the University of Groningen (the only 'non-technical' research university that offers engineering). Doing your masters over here will get you a diploma which employers will recognize, you'll get two years to learn the language a bit - though this is not a requirement like it would be in Germany or France - and you'll build a network so you'll get a job quickly. Starting salaries are about 2800-3000 euros a month before taxes, which puts you on *average* (not even median, which is *far* lower!) salary already at the start of your career for Dutch wages. (Just to put demand into perspective for ChemEngs).|||Tough question. Depend on your definition of EQ really.I for example am really good at reading people. I notice small changes in body language and speech immediately and instinctively know whether that's why someone is sad or is trying to deceive me for example. I also very, very quickly get a feeling for someones character when I meet new people. In this sense, I have very high EQ.But this is the thing, I adjust my own way of speaking, pose and tone of voice to match whatever I want from that person, based on what I read of them. But doing so, is honestly a very rational decision. To be honest, I really lack empathy. I only experience *real* empathy with my dearest friends, close family and my SO. So from this perspective, my EQ is shite.For example, if my employee would come to me with a crisis situation (a dying mother for example) I would be super concerned in tone of voice and body language. I would do anything to accommodate them to arrange things. But this is because I want my employee and team to function best, which is when they feel safe with me as their employer and safe in their job environment. A stressed out employee is useless and will take the whole team down. Better to give them some time off to get their life back in order. I'll find a way to manage until then, that's my job anyway. But honestly, I *couldn't care less* about the dying family member per se. I simply feel nothing. No sadness or any other empathic feelings.|||I *need* time alone. At least 2 to 3 hours daily. I am extremely sensitive to sensory input, especially sound. It exhausts me like you wouldn't be able to understand. I always carry an iPod and headphones and usually listen to music when I'm commuting or need to focus on my thinking, simply to drown out the world and get some time alone with just me and my head. I am definitely TYPE_MENTION though, while I have an TYPE_MENTION boyfriend. Yet, when  talk about introversion in the 'exhaustion' sense of the word, I am *very* introverted, far more than my TYPE_MENTION boyfriend. The thing is, E vs I is something very different in MBTI and despite the fact I am easily exhausted from social interaction due to all the sensory stimuli that come with it, it is the stuff I live on and makes my head able to do what it is best at. For a long time I thought I was an TYPE_MENTION because of the exhaustion, but I am DEFINITELY a COGFUNC_MENTION-COGFUNC_MENTION type, and not a COGFUNC_MENTION-COGFUNC_MENTION.|||I am (as a female) a MRA, but also a feminist. They don't exclude eachother in my oppinion. I believe MRA and Feminism in relationship to Egalitarianism can be explained by imagining the following Venn diagram: MRA and Feminism are both their own circles, which do overlap to a certain extent, while Egalitarianism is a larger circle than encompasses does two circles fully. So yes, in that way, MRA is a subset of Egalitarian believes.|||I have a spare Raspberry Pi doing nothing at the moment which I could turn in a tor proxy. Someone who's already done this?

It serves no purpose to what a bullet journal is supposed to help you with: helping you efficiently and quickly organize your tasks.|||You sound like my boyfriend. :)I'll give you a slightly other point of view. Do you ever talk badly about your own appearance? My SO thinks I'm gorgeous despite having gained weight, but he himself hates his body and constantly brings himself down by saying out loud how fat he is (he isn't...) and how he dislikes his body. This fucks with my head, because all I hear is 'if you call yourself fat, despite even having lost weight, you are a fucking hypocrite and fraud when you tell me I'm beautiful and you make it difficult for me to believe you'.|||Yes! Lot's of physical therapist who get women with back problems tell them after a few sessions without improvement to go to a lingerie store to get proper bra's instead of the PT.|||From your post: So, obviously, some of these are more of an issue than others, but every single one of these little nuggets from your post is a reason that calls for some critical introspection and self evaluation. You need to be in a good place with yourself, before you can actually be a good place for somebody else. Especially your references to suicide in combination with your self proclaimed emotional instability are reasons you need to seek therapy. This is not something to be ashamed about or whatever, it's something you do to make yourself a better person. If anything, you can go into competition with yourself to be the best possible you. How can you expect you can truly and fully love someone, if you clearly can't even bring up enough love to love yourself enough to take proper care of yourself?|||I've been losing weight slow and steady. Recently, I traveled to visit my grandparents in their native country. Considering they are getting very old, and every time I visit might be the last, I decided, fuck it, I'm going to eat ALL the glorious home cooked food my grandmother will make it, and it will be amazing. And it indeed was absolutely amazing. So, back on track again back at home, and just broke through the lowest weight since before I left for my trip. I'm now at 80.5 kg. I've always had my eye on breaking to 80 kg threshold. Almost there... *almost* there.|||It's a fair question, yet something that I have difficulty with to explain. I was raised outside of Serbia, and although my parents (/mother) didn't explicitly raise me based on a strong Serbian heritage, it has been a constant factor throughout my life, as I was raised with the Serbian language, I visited church often as a child, many family members still live in the Balkans who we visit often, my grandparents own lands and houses passed down many generations, etc. My mother decided not to claim citizenship for me, or for herself, as when Yugoslavia fell, she'd been living  in our home country for a *long* time and also gained citizenship of this country, and decided it wasn't worth it to her and felt rather strongly that I in that case also shouldn't get citizenship. However.. I can't explain it, but as I grew older, I simultaneously got more connected to my Serbian heritage and how it influenced my through out my childhood, while also getting more disconnected to it, as without my parents/mother, I didn't have any tangible roots there. It kept eating at me, this feeling of uncertainty, confusion and also a feeling a pride for my background I couldn't place. I felt my mother - by deciding I shouldn't get citizenship - took something from me that actually *did* belong to me.. once I found out I could only claim citizenship through decent until my 23rd (? I believe), I just decided I wanted to do this, as in the end, all I had to loose was some time and money.That being said, I travel a lot as well. And I must admit, having visa free access to countries like Russia and China does have its benefits! :)|||Yup, this is 100% it. I only have a daily amount of fucks to give out, and I certainly don't want to waste any fucks given on some stranger in a rather pathetic break up war. I honestly couldn't care less.|||You know what I think is funny when people don't go to Groningen and instead go to cities like Amsterdam and such? Groningen might not be big, but it's still the only city without night curfews for bars and clubs. Amsterdam for example does have a curfew. This is the only city in the Netherlands where you can literally party and drink until 6-7 in the morning. The same goes with social / student life in general. Groningen might be small, but it lives up to the big cities in many things that students care about. Also, this being a small city means rather cheap living expenses.I do miss the array of specialist shops a big, more metropolitan city has, or the proximity to major international airports, and facilities like major NGO's which I might be interested in to volunteer for being based in major cities. I most likely will move to a bigger city after getting my degree because most big corporations are also based there. Etc. Etc.|||TYPE_MENTION female. I'm quite small and physically rather on the weaker side for a female and I feel intimidated quite often by men who show aggressive behaviour. Not so much if it's aggressive rage behaviour, that stuff is easy to spot and mitigate, but often there are guys who have a mix of aggresive, unstable and emotional (often in combination with alcohol) aura radiating off them which I simply can't properly read and that makes me quite fearful when such guys approach me a bit too close and start talking to me and get into my personal space.|||About CZ, I'm always super afraid that wearing CZ comes across as 'trying to pass them off as diamonds' but clearly they're fake. I wouldn't want that. To me, it feels the same as wearing fake designer handbags, which you wear to show off the brand, and in that case, wearing a fake is just ridiculous.|||Being in a relationship with someone is supposed to make your life happier. Are you happy?|||It's not really a problem with management who are deciding on who to hire. Actually, many European universities have policies in place which highly favour women (in STEM fields) to a point you may very well say it's discriminating. Although yes, these fields usually have less then 20% women in any scientific position that's higher than a post doc level. My own university has research institutes that have none actually. This actually causes problems with regard to work environment and providing role models for students. So.. why are there so little women in academia? No science to back this up, but my own experiences tell me that many women actually *want* to be in academia, as the number of female PhD students is actually quite high, maybe not 50/50 yet for engineering in my country, but still quite good. However, when you want your career to progress in academia you need to be able to handle the work load and stress that comes with really devoting your life to your research and you are also required work abroad for multiple years before getting being able to become a professor (at least in Europe if you want a position at a decent university). After you get in at an assistant professor level it is still a *very* competitive environment. Everything is measured. The amount of PhDs you have, how much grant money you bring in, citation indexes and number of papers.. everything. You want to become an associate professor? Sure, go ahead, if you meet the minimum requirements.. you want to be full professor? Well.. we only have room for 1 full prof for every 2-3 associates.. and really, if you are not good enough to be a full prof, most universities kick you out eventually because there are assistant professor waiting to take your spot which have more potential. Work/life balance in academia is absolutely awful and I believe this is the reason why there are so little women in academia. However, once you get in - which is also something I personally experienced - you are very much respected and treated as equal. Well.. some of the computing science and physics men in their men cave offices need to be told to store away their nude calendar posters once they have a female PhD joining them... but that's about it.|||I did a fsck on my HD, no error code as far as I can tell     ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo fsck /dev/sda2    fsck from util-linux 2.20.1    e2fsck 1.42.9 (4-Feb-2014)    /dev/sda2: clean, 267608/7266304 files, 3388126/29064960 blocksI also did the long 30 min smartctl scan (which is why it took me a while to reply to you).

You need to find a *real* therapist, an actual clinical psychologist who provides professional *health care*. The way how you called it 'an industry' kind of rubbed me the wrong way.. you are not buying some kind of product, damn it, you are trying to get medical assistance, because that's what it is and that's what you need.  A proper therapist will help you change your mindset and behaviour to allow for more introspection. It will definitely not be 'only talk' and you will definitely not be able to just toss the 'discussions' significance' aside, because a good (behavioural) therapist will make you put yourself to *work*. You will be given exercises, stuff to think about, things to write down, etc.. it will definitely not just be random talking about 'deep stuff'.|||It's a cool community but damn they are into the 'pretty, colourful bujo' trend which can become slightly creepy and obsessive from the perspective of someone who just uses bujo as a productivity tool and doesn't give a shit about how the bujo looks as long as the thing does its job properly.|||A Chemistry diploma is any case is a good start, there is more than enough work to be found in this field. Start looking around for post doc positions at universities if you want to go the academic route, but if you don't, look for the big multinationals: Shell, Akzo Nobel, ASML, DSM, pharma industry etc. These companies usually have positions open for chemistry/chemeng students and considering their international culture the language requirements aren't that strict as with smaller companies.I believe in the US when you do graduate school you do a combined masters+PhD track. Depending on how far along you are you can also have a look at taking out your masters and do a PhD in the Netherlands for example, as PhD over here are employees who receive a salary, not students. It is a competitive market though.|||UK graduate, but are you also a UK national?|||You seem like someone who approaches things very directly and rational and doesn't play passive aggressive games. You already informed your SO about your letter.I would simply tell your SO: I have very good reason to believe you are cheating, but if you say you are not, I want to believe you because I love you and want to spend my life with you. And if you're saying you're not cheating, I need you to right here, right now open up your phone, email accounts, bank and credit card statements, Facebook and other social media accounts so I can look through them. You can stand next to me to watch me go through everything, but for the sake of our relationship I need you to do this for me.Make a list of all accounts you want to have a look at beforehand. Also ask to go through his wallet so you can check for any credit cards you didn't know of and maybe you'll find some cash receipts.

If the roles were reversed and you were wrongly accused of cheating, you'd probably be willing to show everything to him, no? So if he doesn't want to... Yup.. he's cheating.Don't tell him about the hotel etc. With some luck, you'll find a CC statement for that hotel.|||Must suck to have reality of how difficult, time consuming and life depriving it is to raise children smack you in the face.|||I'd suggest to take option 1. She is Dutch, we are very, *very* direct in our culture. You can see traces of our cultural directness in how easy it is for her to 'correct' OP about cultural issues, or how she is 'inviting' herself to heritage events (which to her, probably isn't seen as inviting herself, she most likely simply thought she was actually asking, but it clearly didn't come across like that.) As a Dutch person, option 1 really doesn't come across as aggressive to me at all. It simply comes across as clear, upfront communication, which we value.|||I do think CS would be one of the degrees that is doable at B2, the fact that you've been B2 before you spent some time there a few years ago may does not say anything. B to C level is the biggest step to make in language learning, many get stuck on B2, because you need to really get some immersion going on or active daily/every other day training to get from B2 to C1. So unless you have being working at it actively, you'd probably still be at B2.With CS you'll also have no problem finding a job in Europe. And if not in Francce, you can move to Belgium (also bilingual French/Dutch) for example. I live in the Netherlands, and most of the CS students at my uni are picked up by companies way before they graduate.I think what's important now is for you to figure out the visa application process, considering I read below you don't have UK nationality, only ancestry visa and to contact several of the uni's you're interested in and see if they would do an informal assessment of your diploma's to see if you have a good chance of being admitted.|||I agree with this, I speak 5 European languages rather fluently and have read the HP set in 4 of those. Whenever I pick up an Italian/Spanish/Portugese copy (languages I don't know), it's actually doable!|||I love your post. Your husband reminds me very much of my own SO. Silliness galore. Anyway, I wouldn't ask him to stop being his silly self. Can you compromise? In my relationship my SO starts off super silly and I'm like: 'sex? Ok, sure!' (and also sometimes '*really*? No, not right now').. but once we get in bed my SO is rather gentle and romantic. If this is something you'd enjoy as well you could approach him with the question to be more romantic when you get in bed as an explicit foreplay step, you'd simply be adding something new to the current routine, and because of that you're not going to 'hurt his feelings' for him being the funny person he is.|||Both her parents are Turkish though, and I believe Turkey has jus sanguinis laws of nationality. In that case, even if she doesn't have (even if she never applied for) a physical copy of her passport, she still is a Turkish citizen by Turkish law.|||Like you said, they're not considered controlled drugs by the UK. So you'll be fine. However, in many countries psychoactive drugs are controlled and *would* require documentation. I used to have daily heavy opiate based pain medication. If I had to travel with them, I'd need a doctors note, stamped and dated with a couple of official looking stamps and signatures. It never was much of an issue, except that for my opiates, I would need very specific documents with very specific stamps because those *are* controlled substances. If all your bottles have the original stickers *with your name* on them, you should be fine when going through customs. If a customs agents open up your bag, they'll take a look at it, ask you a couple of questions, compare the name on the stickers to the name in your passport and you'd be on your way. If I were you however, I'd simply get a doctors note to take with you, because you might encounter an incompetent customs control agent and it might help you get out of that situation quick and without too many questions (especially considering most of your drugs are anxiety related?). Maybe you can find a general form for the UK controlled drugs and forward that to your doctor so his/her note contains the same info? As your drugs aren't controlled, you wouldn't need to worry about getting the exactly right documentation and stamps like I had to, but I'd get that note, just in case.|||Damn, burn. You kick ass.|||I'm going to remember that one. I like the description, for me at least, the squishy center description feels quite right and it's how I feel, because deep down, I actually feel a lot and very intensely, but its simply not something I have an interest in to share it with the world, outside of my very close ones. Squishy indeed.|||So what happens now is you get into your car, get yourself to whereever your parents are living, park the car, go to the house, tell your kid to get into the car right now, get back in the car and drive away. Your parents just lost the right to ever see your kid again while he's still underaged. |||Behave more 'feminine' before kicking in the badassery. Dress in softer colours to look more feminine and likeable, always smile and ask people how they are doing, how their trip to lake X was last week or if their kid finally recovered from his or her flu. Set the tone by being feminine and soft, and only then be the strong woman who pushes the agenda. (While still smiling kindly.)That also is something in general to keep in mind, also for men, you can be just as effective in reaching your goals and getting through to people without any aggression in your voice AND body language. Being likeable, kind and approachable is very important in getting people on your side. You want people to be on your side because they want to be on your team, and not because they are afraid of you.|||I'm the same (also female) though I do notice that when shit *really* (I mean *REALLY*) hits the fan I do this to an unhealthy extent. As in, I cope by going in overdrive, barely sleep and eat because I keep working on solving the problem, don't allow myself to feel or rest because the moment I do, I would simply utterly collapse. So I keep working and fighting in the hope that once I do collapse it will be once the crisis is over and the others around me have the mental capacity to take care of me.|||I think a monthly limit would work actually. Other posters are saying 'you'll still be spending money, just stop spending it on shit'. But the thing is, you're young, and don't have a lot of experience with making judgement calls on stuff that you need vs want and how useful/fulfilling an item in the end will be. Giving yourself a limit that's low enough so you'll start considering *why* you want a certain item and that will make you pick one thing over another, will teach you these comparison and evaluation skills that will carry over to many other aspects in your life.|||So, I do one thing at thw time, either getting echos, rushing towards a boss, explore a new area, training my parrying, etc. Once I step away from the lantern there is a goal for that run. Explore mode for me is just really that, exploring an area without paying attention to etting echos and even expecting to die. Walking to random places just to see what's around a new corner. When you have that mindset for a specific run you don'y care anymore about looses echos and aren't angry when you die, it takes away a lot of stress and fear.|||You can't make your kid 'become' an TYPE_MENTION. For all you know your kid will end up as an TYPE_MENTION and there is nothing you can do to change that. Ever been around babies of a couple of months old? Ever noticed how even at that age some children are very quiet and some are crying the second they don't get any attention? This was for me the reason why I didn't want children. I would like to have a kid if the kid would be exactly like the kid I envision in my head.. but that's not reality. And being a good parent is able to guide your kid through life regardless of what your kids personality turns out to be.|||The other ladies gave a bunch of great responses I 100% agree with. It's interesting to see how other TYPE_MENTION ladies feel the same like me about having a friend to come home to, someone relaxed who will be honest with you and keep you grounded. No emotional games or drama. Just being able to come home, be home and leave all your stress at the door. Which also means your SO doesn't make an issue of your work and career is really just chill about it and everything else concerning our overly ambitious characters. I find this interesting because this type of man aren't usually the overly ambitious guys like we are, at least not to the same level and intensity as we are. It balances us out I guess. But .. for some reason, I still have a stereotypical idea in my head about us strong TYPE_MENTION women belonging in some kind of 'power couple' relationship with an equally ambitious man. I realize now after so much time with my more laid-back SO that wouldn't make me happy though..|||This question is honestly impossible to answer without more details on where you'll be living.. even where you'll be flying to. Europe is not one country with one overarching justice system. Every country will have its own laws.|||She doesn't get to 'allow' the father to have 50/50 custody. That's really the default any court should strive for, unless there are *very* serious reasons not to do this. As much as you wouldn't like your partner having custody of the kids, your partner has just as much right to the kids as you have.(And I'm saying this as a child of divorce who got fucked over by a pro-mother system of law)|||You should check the entry requirements for a masters in education, like, right now, before you start making plans. EU higher education is not like the US. Here, you usually have to get a bachelor in a field relevant to the master degree you want to do as an admission requirement into the master. There is no 'doing random college stuff' and transferring to law school or med school. No. Here you would do a full bachelor in Law of Medicine (with only courses from that discipline) which you need to get into a master of that field.Education is a bit different though. In my country a masters in Education can mean two things, either a Master in Education Science or a Master that gives you formal accreditation to teach a specific course at high school level, which we would call an Educational Master in German/Mathematics/Physics, etc. The thing is, if you want to do a Master in Education Science, you would need a bachelor degree degree in Educational Science or Pedagogy, a BA in Psychology that does not specialize in Educational Science might not be enough. For an Educational Master, you need a bachelor degree in the field you want to teach. So if you want to do an Educational Master in German, you need a BA Degree in German or European Languages specializing in German. Etc etc.|||Exactly. The relation needs to evolve naturally depending on setting and what you want from the relationship. No mentor/mentee are actually proclaimed mentor/mentee, but if done right, both will know that that's indeed the nature of their relationship.|||You're Dutch, so he first one, just let it slide, live and let live, don't bother yourself with other people's business, blabla, that's how we rol. Next time this happens however tell your teacher after class you don't find it appropriate and as do many others in youe class. Let the teacher solve this. Again, you're Dutch, so nobody will feel awkward or angry or whatever if you just state your oppinion rationally.|||I met my SO when I was 18, at my first week of uni nonetheless, and he was close to 6 years older than me. We have now been together for over 4 years and live together as well, and we have one of the most healthy relationships I know among my friends and acquaintances. But here is the thing: I had been through some heavy shit in my teenage years and was on all accounts very much more mature than the average 18 year old. Yes, my SO was in a different life stage, but we were able to communicate and understand eachother on the same emotional level. We were also both at a very emotionally stable point in our lives. We were and are in many ways eachothers equal and grew together over the years.The thing that worries me about this girl is how she talks about 'being lonely'. That in it very self shows she's not emotionally stable enough to handle a tricky non standard relationship because of the age difference. She does not seem to act out of infatuation or love for you specifically, but simply out of the need for emotional comfort. And that's not something you should want for your life.|||Yeah sure, these are things you can compromise on, and yes, you are right that non of these things are deal breaker level issues.But.. at *only* 2 months in, did you consider the option that maybe you two simply aren't very compatible people when it comes to being in a relationship with one other?That would be no one's fault really.. some people just don't go that well together.|||Hi! I have a rather unusual size, I'm shorter than average and have an hourglass figure with a big hip to waist circumference difference. I rarely find clothes that actually fit. I practically need every piece of clothing I buy (unless it's basic t-shirts) to be taken to a seamstress, but this makes me hesitant to buy things because I never really know beforehand if a seamstress is able to make the alteration I need. So I guess my question is: what are the big no-no's in terms of what is and isn't fixable and what are the things that actually are easily fixable but people usually don't know about? Knowing this will help me a lot when I go shopping again!|||So, I have top comment on the thread you are referring to.It's not about marriage per se, like you, I don't think marriage is that important. Although I personally would like to get married, if my partner was anti marriage, I'd be fine with that too. The whole point of my comment in that thread however is about knowing there is no long term outlook. If you *know* your relationship will end badly in X years because you have some big disagreements, which well end in drama and heartbreak.. why prolong the inevitable? Especially because the longer you wait, the uglier the break up will be.To answer your second question.. yes, I am in a relationship with someone I intend to marry (4 years and counting!). If I didn't see myself with my SO long term, to me, there wouldn't be a point to staying together with him.Also, I personally have no desire to date casually. I don't feel any desire to sleep with guys I don't feel romantically attracted to and besides, I am confident enough in myself + my life is existing enough that I don't feel some weird fear of being alone or feeling worthless if I'm not in a relationship.|||I'll graduate with double the debt and will be paying it back under the 35 years rules. I've decided to only make minimum payments. It's just not worth it with the current inflation + low interest. Besides, with the combined debts of me and my SO, there is a big chance the government will pay a large chunk of the remaining balance after 35 years. There is one important caveat though. I do not plan on ever buying a house. If you want a mortgage from a Dutch bank they'll have a look at all your 'registered debts', your study loans aren't part of those. They'll ask you to provide them that info out of your own free will, however, you are not required to. If you do, they'll be counted rather heavily against the maximum mortgage you can get. If you don't, they won't count those debts. HOWEVER, if you don't declare your study debts you forfeit your right to ever claim 'NHS garantie' if you go bankrupt and need to sell your house below value.Like I said, I won't be buying a house, so I don't care for this. Whether it's relevant for you is something only you can decide.|||To me it feels like immense jealously towards you, because of a perceived 'failure' on his side to get that job. Followed by rationalization of behaviour he *knows* is stupid and irrational by suddenly being pro-American capatilism, anti-socialism and all the other out of the blue things he's saying about Europe/the Netherlands.I think you need to sit down with him and simply say straight to his face: 'You are behaving like crap and you're acting like a child. We made this decision together and you need to get your act straight. This is going to happen, I am going there, whether you like it or not, with or without you.'I don't think with this behaviour that any subtle steering of his behaviour will have any effect.|||Hoe vaak gebruik je usenet?

I mean, no one trips and 'accidentally' find their penis in someones vagina (or vice versa).

The only reason I got into STEM is because my father was my big advocate and called everyone out who tried to tell me 'STEM isn't for girls, why don't you choose a social science instead, you're probably not good enough at mathematics anyway to be an engineer'. If you go to an engineering or physics department at your local uni, you'll find most of the girls there have similar stories.|||I agree, calling out random strangers is a stretch. There is a lot of gray area between personal friends and random strangers though.. and I personally feel there is a lot to be said about speaking up against acquaintances as well! At least, I try to speak up to other women being sexist when I consider them acquaintances as well. They certainly wouldn't physically attack you...  The whole point is we need to change societal values to achieve our goals towards true gender equality. That only happens when we are focal about it and become the dominant voice. One person convincing one other person on this topic, who will convince one person themselves, is truly all it takes.|||Bullet journal.

Deze mensen kiezen heel specifiek voor een beroepsopleiding waarvan ze vooraf erg goed weten wat hun loopbaan in gaat houden en welke orde grootte van salaris er aan zo'n loopbaan verbonden is. Als dat perspectief onvoldoende voor hen is, was een carriere als PO leraar misschien niet de juiste keuze.|||TYPE_MENTION are often scary to talk to, both my SO and best friend understand how to communicate with me though. Bottom line is this:At any point in life, work, project, whatever, I know exactly where I'm going and how I'll get there. This does not mean this route is set in stone, but it does mean this is the best path I could come up with having considered everything. So, both my SO and friend often tell other people who are a bit intimidated by me: \\\"when you discuss things with Avacyn, it feels like kicking a dead horse and she simply doesn't *want* to listen because she thinks she knows best. But in reality she is actually listening very closely, and is simply challenging you on your own opinion in any way she can come up with. Give it a week or two, and if your argument was strong enough, she'll get back to you with new updated plans based on your input.\\\"This was a huge eye opener for many people in my social circle, but also for myself, as I honestly did not know how my behaviour came across to other people who aren't used to thing style of discussing things.|||Same as with any RFID really.

Just make sure not to move the chip around too much while the tissue is still healing to make sure the chip will stay in its place until your hand is healed.|||Dutch. I needed *a lot* of medical care, both emergency care and planned non emergency surgeries. I think the biggest thing that important to understand is that in my country, not a single person would even stop to think about going to a doctor, or ordering an ambulance or whatever. It's the most normal thing ever to go to your GP if you have issues, or questions or are unsure about your health. Ambulances are released as a standard practise for any road accident or whenever police has to show up to a situation with only the *possibility* of needing medical care. This can be as much as just checking for concussions after a minor car accident. Nobody worries about costs or avoids doctors because of cost. I pay 120 euros a month in insurance, but also get 80 euros from the government each month because I'm a low income student. GP visits don't cost anything, but specialist care does, to a maximum of about 300-400 euros a year, as that's the maximum by law. This systems can only be run because of a meticulous gatekeeping system. No one can just randomly walk into a hospital for treatment. For non emergency care, you need a referral from your GP or dentist, and yes, waiting lists are involved. For emergency care, the only way in to the ER is either by calling an ambulance for life threatening emergencies or through the GP (or the 24/7 outpost GP) who will refer you to the ER. For example, I broke my ankle. Not realizing how bad it was, I didn't call an ambulance but instead called the GP outpost (it was the middle of the night) and booked an appointment about 1 - 1.5 hours later. In this case, the doctors assistant who run the reception act as gatekeepers and decide whether you may or may not need an ambulance instead. You could also just call our 911 and the dispatcher will be the gatekeeper. When I got there, they gave me a referral to the ER and I went straight over. Once at the ER I had to wait maybe 30 minutes to see a doctor, but in the meantime, the nurse stopped by multiple times to get me some painkillers etc. After diagnosis, everything is taken care of for you. The hospital will plan all your appointments and surgeries first thing in the morning and they will call you informing you about everything. When I was admitted, there was never any pressure to get me off the ward as soon as possible. Theyd rather keep me for a few more days if they weren't sure about my recovery. No questions asked. But yeah, the day that you do leave, they ask you to leave quickly and not linger, as they'll fill the bed within hours of you leaving. Over the past two years, I needed 7 surgeries, multiple hospitalizations and lots of specialist medication. Total cost to my insurer: about 30k. Total cost to me, including monthly insurance pay, maybe 1 to 1.5k|||Looking for quality dark blue denim jeans, problem: 45\\\" hips vs. 32\\\" waist.

For example, I'm quite a young TA, maybe just 1 or 2 years older than most of my students. Would that matter in terms of being 'authoritative'?It's funny how different this is. Within STEM we are incredibly laid back and non-hierarchical. For example, a conversation with a prof (let's call him prof. dr. John Stuart) when I enter a lecture could easily go like this and no one would bat an eye: 'Hi John.' 'Hi Avacyn. You look tired, late night yesterday?'. 'Yeah... the study association had a party last night, it was great fun, but I might not have prepared for class today.' and the prof would just laugh it off and not care.|||You'll simply never know for sure to be honest. Things to check: can you do multiple degrees without additional cost (I can at my uni)? Can you take additional classes without cost? Are you free to choose a minor during your degree in a totally different, unrelated subject? What in general is the policy regarding switching fields for your master?For example, my uni offers a finance master which you can do with an engineering background, provided you choose a very specific set of courses + some extra work load for your minor. I ended doing two bachelor's degrees. ChemEng and Industrial Engineering &amp; Management. Now I'm doing 3 masters, included a full on business master. I *really* loved adding business and management courses and stuff to my engineering stuff to broaden my horizon a bit an see stuff from different perspectives. If you are also lucky enough to be academically gifted, know that it doesn't stop with just this one decision. You can add stuff to fine-tune your academic path to your tastes and interests, which *will* develop and change over time. As long as you choose a solid foundation for your primary studies, you will be fine.|||Credit card usage in Europe is minimal, although you'll fine bigger place will sill accept CCs. People here use debit cards almost exclusively. In terms of housing (I'm guessing you're going to rent) it will depend on your income. Your rental company might require you to show a proof of income, and many require an income that is 3-5 times the cost of the rent. If you can't show your income, they won't rent it to you. The same with things like mortgages, where the bank will base the height of mortgage they're willing to provide based on your existing debts (which are all registered in a centralized national register) and your proof able income. This is why you'll find self-employed people or people on temp contacts having a harder time getting mortgages. That being said, there are a lot of rental companies focussing on expats, I'm not quite sure what kind of system they use.|||Your posts remind me of me when I was your age (now about 10 years down the line). I was around your age when I was also in full doubt about my own style and I was struggling at home emotionally. Around your age (maybe a tad bit younger) I went through an all out goth period because of it.Needless to say, I 'grew out of it', but that time did teach me something very valuable. Going all out on the spectrum of what is socially acceptable, and lets be honest, on the teenage girl spectrum, very little is socially acceptable, put me in a category that was totally outside of any social convention. It was hard, and not everybody around me accepted me for it, but in the end, it thought me that I don't need acceptance or acknowledgement from anyone else but myself. I went to the extreme side of expressing myself through appearance, got burned and had to face social outcry because of it, but in the end after the world around me got used to me 'being different', I settled on a style that was me, which is still for many 'outside' of the traditional fashion norm (lot's of pretty vintage inspired silhouettes with a modern twist to take it to the 21st century), but it made me happy. Now I find myself in a place where I can wear anything I want, because I still am not worried at all about what others may think, and despite being outside of the norm, I get *so* many compliments on how I look, because I am confident and secure in how I carry myself.If you dare, I would totally recommend you doing you and wearing what you like. Hell, take it 2 steps further and *dare* to wear stuff of which you *know* people will hate it and love yourself for it. Embrace being different. Embrace being your own individual self. And keep repeating to yourself nobody needs to like you, but you.|||This question has been asked very often.

Even if tomorrow you would suddenly find yourself CEO of the company, you wouldn't be able to change shit if the company culture isn't allowing drastic change (such as replacing people in several key positions, which is a common move for new CEOs). Culture is *really* slow to change and requires more status quo shake up than an individual can accomplish.|||I'm with an TYPE_MENTION and all your threw bullet points are also important to me in a relationship and is also what I get out of my relationship. One thing that I think could be a major issue in TYPE_MENTION x TYPE_MENTION relationship is the degree of being grounded in the relationship. I'm all over the place, I'm dreaming and planning to go to the moon so to say, and even before reaching the moon, im already planning my next trip to Mars. My TYPE_MENTION loves me ambition but lacks such ambition himself, he tags along with my dreams and plans instead and makes sure that even while dreaming and planning, I don't lose track of what's right on front of me. With two TYPE_MENTION I think the biggest hurdle would be alignment of future plans and goals. I can imagine both TYPE_MENTION would drift apart rather quickly because they are so obsessed about their future dreams and plans, they actually forget to invest a lot into the relationship in the right here and now. And for a relationship to work, it does need a lot of constant investment (and also sacrifice) in the present, that's not something that can be planned for.|||The S5 is seriously the best phone I have *ever* owned.

Considering 180 ECTS to a degree, you can already cut out (generally speaking) about 30 ECTS in terms of a minor. If you take degrees A and B, you simply put a minor of A in degree B and vice versa. Also, when you look at the Bologna criteria of degrees, you'll notice that many of the skills you need to show to get your degree are rather generic. Once you figure out which criteria are filled through which course, you can quite easily convince the examinations board to count some ECTS on both degrees. Finally, if you take multiples in the same field and your degree has some room for electives, you can usually also get the examinations board to count some courses from degree A in B and vice versa. Realistically? If you are willing to put in the effort and figure out the specifics of how a degree is build up, you can reduce each 180 ECTS degree to about 110-120 ECTS per degree. Especially if you can combine thesis projects in some way, it becomes very doable.|||Ok, that's definitely surgery in your case... was this a Dutch dentist or your dentist back home?If it was your dentist back at home, take those x-rays to a Dutch dentist and ask for a referral, as these procedures will *not* be done by dentists in the Netherlands, but only by dental *surgeons*. You will need a referral to one of Groningen's hospital. This is not optional. In the Netherlands you cant just walk into a hospital and get treatment, unless you are being brought in from an ambulance in life and death situations. You need a referral from a primary care provider (dentist or GP) to get in. -- this also is something good to know in general though. If you find yourself in a situation where you might need medical care outside of office hours, *don't* go to the ER directly (again, unless it's in an ambulance), but call the 'huisartsenpost', which is a centralized GP office which is available during out of office hours. If necessary, they will give you an immediate referral to the ER, but if you show up at the ER without a referral for a non life or death situation, Dutch insurance will *not* cover your expenses. It's a common procedure, you probably won't have to stay in the hospital ('dagbehandeling', day treatment). I've looked up the waiting times for the university hospital, according to their website, the waiting times at the dental surgery department is about 4 weeks for these basic procedures. Usually the other non-academic hospitals are a bit shorter, but at least this gives you an indication. This waiting time if from the moment your dentist provides their referral to the hospital and they register you. I've also needed jaw surgery. I found the surgeons at the university hospital to be very kind, helpful and professional, and the hospital itself is very modern and well equipped. You should check with your insurance company whether they'd cover the costs. I don't have a specific breakdown of the costs, but if I'd have to make a rough measurement, it would probably cost in the 1000-1800 euros range to have them extracted surgically in the hospital. This was what my insurance company paid for a 'day treatment' issue I had that required local anesthetics (but not ortho related though).|||Reading through your comments, I didn't yet get an answer on why the simple reason given by most child free people isn't valid. That simply being ' I don't want to. '(With this question I'm trying to get to a core value you're experiencing that may conflict with core values of child free people.)|||Yes! I shop most of my clothes online at www.topvintage.nl It's a Dutch webshop, but I think they ship to most countries. Their customer service is amazing, their prices on par with most (online and offline) shops selling those brands, and - this is important! - they measure every item they sell in house themselves and provide detailed measurements specific to that product. Anyways, if I can give you a few pointers of how the style works for me: choose one more eccentric item (strong print, distinctive cut, out-there colour) combine it with basics that would fit in a more modern day setting, to make sure it's not too costume-y. The same goes with shoes and jewelry, as vintage inspired outfits go quite good with more minimal, modern shoes and jewelry. I recently put the following outfit together: [skirt](https://topvintage.nl/nl/vintage-retro/50s-bridget-tartan-flare-skirt-in-grey?) and [shirt](https://topvintage.nl/nl/vintage-retro/50s-dune-jumper-in-burgundy?) and I wore the gray belt of the skirt over the waistline of the shirt so there was a bit of color blocking going on. Paired with basic, black, leather, healed sandals and a silver hair brooch. I got *a bunch* of compliments on it and although the silhouette is very vintage-y, it didn't make me feel out of place.|||I did, I still do. Same as you, my fantasy world saved me. With an NMum and an emotional unavailable dad following an awful divorce when I was 12, I fell into a depression. Undiagnosed, considering nobody gave enough of a fuck to see I was struggling. I didn't even realise myself back then, only put the piece together once I was preparing to move out, live on my own and met people who were diagnosed. Anyway, I would spend countless hours daydreaming. Mostly based on novels and movies, most of which already named by other commenters. My daydreaming mostly included building imaginary relationships with fictional characters. Mothers, fathers, siblings, friends, romantical interests. 100s of them. Most of the time spent in the dreams were mostly just talking, imagening how that relationship works. I would daydream for *at least* 5 hours a day, usually a lot more.The thing is, by doing so, I learned a lot about myself and my parents. Frankly, by doing so I subconsciously worked my way out of a depression by projecting therapist roles unto characters. I learned my own strengths and weaknesses and what I want out of life and my relationships.I'm now in my 20s and  in a really happy place and am loved by many people. I still daydream though. There are several characters from my childhood day dreams I hold very dear and up till this day I daydream and continue to expand those imaginary relationships. A lot less often obviously, but usually still in those dull moments before falling a sleep or when riding my bicycle to class. The day dreams are still a safe haven.|||I'm an engineer myself so I need a lot of math and it was a requirement for entry into my degree programme. My uni did a large scale analysis of which factors can be a predictor of academic success. The biggest surprise was that how well a student does in high school maths is a *very strong* predictor for how well the student will do at university. This held true across all disciplines, even stuff like Art History degrees. So, we wondered, why would this be? To me it's clear: maths learns you determination and learning how to critically think, reflect and analyse stuff on a *highly* abstract level. All of these are qualities you need for not only stem degrees, but also arts degrees which require to you to think creatively but still require a very analytical approach of that creative process to truly understand it. So no, you might not *need* maths when you want to make films, but you *will* need the skills learning maths teaches you to become truly good at what you do.|||Just because I'm curious, what link does mental visualization have with MBTI that makes you ask about it?|||What I really liked about BB vs DS is how from thw start on there actually was a story, even though world was still cryptic and vague as with DS. With DS, the story of your character doesn't *really* evolve past 'I woke up in a random place shit where am I?' and throughout the game you learn primarily things about the world your in, not necessarily a story of your characters role in that world. That being said, I'm really looking forward to being a magic character again. All my main DS chars are magic based. Just hope DS can learn from BB and vice versa.|||I do think in these cases it is important to realize that the total costs are not 0 kronor. The cost is there, but it's paid for through taxes etc.|||That moment when you understand the English phrase, but need to look up the translation of that phrase in your native language because you don't know how the fuck the translate it yourself.|||Don't be fooled by it though. You should read up on the disparity between what you as an employee get before taxes and what you cost your employer. In the EU an emoloyee costs his or her employee about double their before taxes salary, which puts it on par with US salaries. That's the price you get for not having to worry about your retirement (which is by law the resposibilty of your employer), not having to worry about getting sick and loosing your job (by law your employer cant easily fire sick employees and need to insure themself against it), not having to worry about loosing your job to begin with at al because your employer has to pay extra taxes to provide you with governmental financial aid on the level of your former salary for an x number of months if you do loose your job. This and loads and loads of other social security measurements which US employees simply don't have because in the US mentality you need to take care of yourself insteas of relying on the government.It's a different system. A different mentality. One not necessarily better than the other (I would absolutely love to be in control of my own retirement funds for example, but alas, by law I can't..), just different.|||Than my question to you is: what benefit would me having children bring to the world or humanity?Like someone else says, when you ask most parents why they got children the sentence starts with 'I wanted...' and not 'because it would better mankind'.Countless generation did not reproduce so I could be born, they did it because they felt lonely, wanted something to care for or be cared for, wanted to be a parent or 1000 other reasons I can come up with that have nothing to do fighting for humanity to survive so I could have been born. Actually: if the survival of mankind is the goal, I'm doing the world a favour by not reproducing because of the overpopulation. :P|||In Europe you won't be as likely to find a wide range of engineering degrees. Mostly it's just ME, EE, CE and the like. What you would see is certain universities specializing in specific types of engineering, but usually as a subset of one of the major engineering sections. For example, a 'Petroleum Engineer' would really just be called a Chemical Engineer in Europe that ended up in Gas and Oil, although some specific uni's do offer some specializing courses in petroleum engineering. That's why you most likely didn't have any luck googling for an environmental engineering degree in Europe. Maybe you can explain what you exactly expect from your environmental engineering degree? What kind of courses, jobs and research do you associate with this type op engineering?|||Where are you right now? If your in the UK you'd be able to just see a random municipality office to ask your question face to face, if you're in the US, maybe you live in a major city with an embassy? Embassies exist to help you with these issues. You might not even need to go *through* an embassy, maybe you can even apply online if the UK offers a service like that, but your issue right know is that you need expert advice on the right way to apply, and you most likely won't get it here.|||Thanks for you comment. It's not stressing me out at all, I'm actually going to take on a third degree next autumn. I'm doing what I'm talented in and it comes easy to me. Luckily my country provides low interest loans to students, so I'll never run out of immediate cash if I need it, what stresses me out however are the thoughts of my ever rising loan and the uncertainty of my financial future. It's a bit of gamble, taking on extra degrees among other valuable experiences and extra curriculars at the expense of a higher loan to replay in the end vs. adding a lot more hours into a job with minimum wage and not doing what I'm doing now but not having student loans in the end. However, I think I'm making the right decisions, as through all these experiences I'm making myself a very valuable asset to the companies I'm interested in based on what these companies in my country are selecting on. It's just... it would be *so* much easier if I 'just' had parents  'like everyone else' who would help out.|||Yes, I'm certain! I was recently told on this sub about the UK/Ireland issue that they demand EU *residency* and was shocked, because as far as I understood all EU mainland countries only ask *citizenship*, it's definitely the case in the Netherlands.|||I really don't get your problem, you're l over the place right now. Is it the age difference? I (TYPE_MENTION) met my SO (TYPE_MENTION) when I was 18 and he was 23. Still together almost 4 years later.|||While women in other European countries fought for equal pay and working hours, women in the Netherlands fought for government support to combine part time jobs with government support to raise children. As a result, most mothers work, although part time. The last 10 years or so it happens more and more that the father also starts working part time to equal the parenting job between each other. Maternity leave is available, although only up to 3 months or so for women, 2 days for the father to get the child registered. After three month the woman goes back to work, which means most children will go to day care from the age of 3 months  till about 3 years when they enter kindergarten. Abortion etc is in general accepted, though we have in general a bit of a 'as long as it isn't in my backyard' mentality. (Same goes for homosexuality for example).I've read the post of /u/CamillaBlu about France and it's about the same over here. Few things that might be considered weird in other cultures:When given birth, family usually visits the first week already. This is because our universal health care will pay for a sort of midwife to come to your home 8 hours a day for the first 8 days or so to clean your house and teach the new parents how to take care of the baby. To continue on that one: close family, as in parents/grandparents will most likely want to be at the hospital while you're giving birth, sometimes even be with your in the room during pregnancy. C-section rates are incredibly low and long pregnancies are not uncommon. Want an epi? You need to be in *pain* and practically scream at the midwifes to get one. It's not that evident to get one as it is in other countries. We have obgyns but you'll barely see one during your pregancy, as most check ups are done by midwifes and you'll only see if obgyn if there is reason to see one according to the midwife. I think the Dutch keep quite to themselves, you don't see very young children in restaurants often for example and child menu's aren't really the norm. Of course some times kids are in the way once they are walking around, but really I've not witnessed many public tantrums etc. If Dutch children can't behave, most parents tend to keep them at home. That's my perception at least.|||So much this. I have so many people who call me a polyglot due to being raised multilingual + my parents encouraged foreign language learning from a very early age. When I look at people claiming they are 'fluent' I seriously just want to slam my head against a wall. My own language proficiency across the 7 languages I have studied (or at least tried to study) vary a lot from A1 to a solid C2. By know, I believe that true fluency is a very, *very* solid B2+, but better yet, a C1 level. If you look at the official definitions of B2/C1, and compare that to the proficiency of those people with blogs etc, you'll notice that they usually don't even come close. To put the time needed to get to B2/C1 level in perspective: So in my case, I am someone who already knows a bunch of (European) foreign languages quite well. If I were to study a new Romance or Germanic language, I would get to a solid B2+ after about 3 years of studying with weekly classes, or just under 2 years, if I would put in substantial, continuous effort (say 12-18 hours a week of dedicated study + weekly classes). The gap between B2 and C1 is huge. Look it up, you'll be surprised! I would need 1-2 years to bridge that gap, depending on how much immersion I could get.For a non Romance or Germanic language, say, Mandarin which I'm studying right now, it would probably take me about 5 years to get to basic B2-/B2 level with weekly classes, and another 2-3 years to get to C1. Of course, it would cost me less time if I would dedicate a significant amount of time to my studies, like I explained before. I notice my fellow classmates who don't already know several languages struggle a lot more, because they don't have the advantage of 1. Having had *a lot* of practice and knowing what method of studying a new language works best for you.2. Being able to see a lot of connections between similar languages you already know.Learning a new language is dedicating yourself to a long term multi year project. It's not easy and it *will* take a lot of time. That's simply the reality of it.|||Nah, just buy the cheap ones meant for notebooks and stuff to write your name on.

At 17 I was fed up with my mum's controlling behaviour and after looking up my rights I found out at that age I was in my right to *choose* with which parent I wanted to live.

In all honestly.. looking back it has still been one of my *best* decisions ever.|||Over geleend geld, meer mensen delen die mening en ik ken de argumenten. En hoewel ik er respect voor heb en die argumentatie kan begrijpen, wil ik alleen laten weten dat dit voor mij een hele bewuste en gecalculeerde keuze geweest is om er mee om te gaan zoals ik doe. En ja, alles kan veranderen maar om vooruit te komen moet je nou eenmaal een stip op de horizon zetten en zo goed mogelijk je reis uitplannen. Dat niet alles gaat als gepland en je moet improviseren along the way is absolutut een gegeven maar alsnog ga je naar mijn mening alsnog een betere reis tegemoet als je plant en open staat voor de mogelijke problemen dan wanneer je niet weet waar je naar toe aan het varen bent, want in dat geval overkomt alles je zonder dat je er op voorbereid bent.Dank voor je antwoord!|||Oh hey, I remember their last post and was trying to find it a couple of weeks back, but couldn't.

The only reason I eat pizza is because sometimes life simply sucks and I really can't bring myself to cook proper food. So I get a pizza and pop it in the oven. The thing is. Those things are like 1k kcal a pop! For fucks sake, I really don't need more than 1700 kcal a day. I wish I could find an alternative for pizza that's just as easy, half the calories, but not too much more expensive. A pizza in my country is about 2 euros, the nice salads and microwave steam dinners are all 5 euros or something.. which is just too much. Something under 3 euros would be perfect.|||Thank you for this link, love it!|||Visas are tough, especially for labour that doesn't require highly specialised education, as the spot can be filled by someone domestic/EU based and as such, disqualifies immediately for a visa.I think the best bet for US citizens to get into Europe is to work for multinationals which encourage relocation (and have your employer deal with immigration) or through student visas and go to uni to get a EU degree, which opens up a lot of doors to skilled work visas if you make it a priority to netwerk with companies throughout your studies. Edit: internships in Dutch education are usually always part of the educational curriculum and count towards study credits. The way many US students do random summer internships to pump up their resumes is something that's not really done in the Netherlands. There is no 'internship visa' as it would fall under a student visa.|||Can somebody explain me the concept of TJ Maxx? I'm not US based and recently one of their stores opened in my city.

I'm in the process of getting my second nationality as well, which is from a previous war torn country with lot of border issues in recent pasts so it was incredibly hard to find out whether I was able to claim nationality based on decent. A few mails back and forth the conclusion was I wasn't able to claim decent based on technicalities but there was another obscure law that *would* grant me nationality. Embassies exists for this very reason.|||Finally. Thanks for this. I'm doing both an engineering and business degree, and to me, yes, the business degree is a lot easier. But in all honesty, most of the engineering students that regularly shit on social sciences would in my assessment fail miserably if they'd try to get a degree in those areas. It's a different science, you really can't compare it.|||We also have  'Ba/BSc in whatever', no weird college systems like in the US, but within that programme, usually there a a few elective courses you're allowed to fill with courses from outside of your field. These electives can be filled up with courses from your second degree and vice versa. It's really strange you're not allowed to do multiples at once, I mean, even if you can't shorten your main programme due to the electives, if you're able to do a higher course load (as in number of courses) and still pass everything, what's the problem? I find it quite detrimental for students who have the capability to do so and aren't able to reach their full potential.In my country it gets even better: you only have to pay tuition fees once, and the tuition fees for any subsequent studies are covered by the university (provided you do them simultaneously, not after one another).|||At what age did you start finding fellow TYPE_MENTION women?

We simply couldn't communicate whatsoever. TYPE_MENTION is a COGFUNC_MENTION dom type..

For example, if it is a Catholic wedding it would be proper etiquette to make sure your dress fully covers your shoulder and knees, a modest dress in general.

This matters when choosing your outfit of course.|||Fachhochschule and Hochschule are used interchangeably. In this context, they are indeed the same.  There is a name generally used in Europe for these kind of institutions: University **of Applied Science** It's confusing for outsiders though, because within the system where you can find these institutions, there is definitely a difference in educational level between UoAS and regular universities. They have distinctly different educational profiles and educate their students for different jobs and roles. For example, both a UoAS and a university might offer Chemical Engineering, but a UoAS degree in ChemEng would be more like being educated to become an operator at a plant, while an academic would be trained for engineering research and development, and plant design. Just like both UoAS and universities might both offer a Chemistry degree, but with the first you'd get a job in a lab as a research technician or analyst, while with the second you'd be the one to do the in depth lab work. Both are valuable and needed in society, but it's simply training people for different types of jobs.|||He's not going to loose weight if he ruins his knees before he gets the chance to loose any.

However, I would *not* agree to give this course myself, as that will reinforce their idea that you are the person to help the rest of the company out with their excel illiteracy.Once that's done, everytime someone puts in a request that's clearly not part of your job, I'd simply tell them: I'm sorry, this is not part of my responsibilities at this company and as such, I cant spare the time to help you. I put forward a proposal for a course so your department can learn the necessary skills, you should ask your own manager about it.|||Honesty, your family may think what they want, but you should not set the standard of 100% native fluency for *yourself* whatever language you decide to do. Why? Because an adult learning a new language will *never* reach a full 100% native proficiency. You can get very, very good at a language, but the language will never be as hard wired in your brain as the language you grew up with and you will very likely have an slight foreign accent the rest of your life. With that in mind, whatever you choose you will never be able to please your family. So make sure you set your own standards and go from there.The above by the way is especially true for Dutch, which is an *extremely* tough language to truly master. Learning the basics is easy, but becoming fluent is not. I am Dutch and I have yet to meet somebody who learned Dutch as a second language in adulthood who speaks it like a native. This includes people like my mother, who speaks several languages fluently, including Dutch, but she still doesn't speak Dutch quite like a native, even though she's been here over 30 years since she was 20 years old.|||If you're in high school, don't work if you don't have to money wise, but instead learn everything you possibly can. I took every elective course I could, including multiple languages, starting from age 12 through 18. Because of this, I am now anywhere between proficient and fluent in 6 languages. These are skills you'll profit from the rest of your life, but also skills you won't have time and energy for to develop later in life.. I couldn't have done this if I had to work instead of being able to study.I went on to study STEM and honestly, I'm nearing the end of my studies and you wouldn't believe the market for STEM graduates with extensive foreign language knowledge.

Start building a relationship with the secretaries on your own team, listen to them, appreciate them, acknowledge them. They may have a quite good relationship with the secretary of the person you are trying to reach, so you could ask your own departments secretary to have a chat with the other secretary on your behalf. Also, when you have a reason actually be at the office of whoever, always make sure to be a few minutes early so you have the chance to chat with the secretaries of other people. Again, build relationships, get to know them, let them get to know you. It's only human to try and accommodate someone you like just a bit more than other people.Another trick is to at least have the person you want to meet know you. For example during some after work drinks or network events or whatever. Talk about meaningful stuff. When you encounter a gatekeeper, you can also say 'person X and I discussed subject A back then, based on that discussion I figured person X might be interested in subject B as well, for which I would like an appointment'. It's more difficult for a gatekeeper to keep strict and keep people out when there is already some kind of relationship between you and who you are trying the reach in place.|||This is good stuff.

There is a huuuge disconnect between passive and active skills beyond the A-level.|||You don't need a visa if you hold a passport. It is a bit complicated but essentially you cross a border twice when you change country. The exit border of the country you're in and the entry border of the country you enter. So, if you travel from Australia to the UK, and you have both passports, you show your Australian one at the exit border of Australia, and your UK one at the entry of the UK. When you fly back, you again show your UK on at the exit border of the UK and the Australian one at the entry border of Australia. You could also enter the UK with your Australian passport (though it is not recommended at all, even if it is legal, because if some countries it isn't), but in that case, yes, you'd need a visa.The trick is to always match passports for entry and exit. So you SHOULD NEVER enter the UK with the Australian passport and leave on your UK one. Why? Because your (Australian) passport is likely to be stamped and registered and if you leave on your UK passport you won't have a valid exit stamp in your Australian one, which causes a lot of issues with immigration down the road, because essentially, it seems as though you are still illegally in the UK past your visa limitations.|||This was very, *very* good and summed up exactly why I as a woman refuse to call myself a feminist and why I keep telling people that for western societies, if women want equality, we need to start addressing the problems of how men are forced (often by women!) to be masculine and all the problems that come from that.|||In my country any child older than 12 has the right to be heard by a judge on his or her parenting arrangements. If the child is mature enough about it, the judge will usually decide in favour of the childs wishes. The older the child, the more weight the childs voice carries. When I was 16 or 17 for example I simply told my nmum I was going to live with my dad full time, even though they had a 50/50 split. Nothing she could do about it, because the judge would always decide in my favour in this case. Maybe there are similar laws in your state/country.|||I actually read beyond good and evil for my philosophy class at .. 15 years old? I still have my original essay on it. Probably one of the best essays I've ever written during my high school time. I guess you could say that - depending on your perspective - that book fucked up my perspective on ethics for life.Thank you for reminding me of this. I'm going to pick up a copy of that book and reread it.|||Same at 22F. Based of your flair, I want to be exactly like you in 20 years or so.|||I was raised trilingual of which 2 languages weren't native languages of my parents, and the third was only a native language to one of them. My parents have a strange history of being raised in foreign countries and not learning their mother tongues untill later in their childhood when they moved back home. Being from different cultures, after I was born, my parents were still learning eachothers language while using English as a shared language. Looking back, it went rather OK. I have quite some issues with grammar in all languages as I mix them up a lot and my parents never really were able to properly teach me grammar as they themselves never were taught grammar properly. The thing that made a world of difference is how they exposed me to the original language, outside of them speaking the language to me. Lot's of books, movies and childrens songs in all three languages. That way, even if they made mistakes, I would still learn the language the right way because my parents weren't my main source of interaction with the language.|||Most masters are 1 year in Europe and the two year masters are called 'research masters'. Law for example (as /u/Smartare noticed) can be done in 1 year or at some uni's 2 years. In both cases you will take 1 year of specialized courses and in the second year the research master students will do full time research. Here is the trick: all STEM fields **only** have research master degrees!|||I never carry cash anymore. There is a homeless guy sitting who's always outside our local grocery store. The guy was super friendly to everyone. I always have a heavy heart when I see homeless people but am also worried a donation ends up buying drugs. So one day I stopped and ask the guy if I could get him anything from the store. He asked for a bottle of coca cola. It's so much easier to buy goods than to just give money.|||Both my parents are practically jobless actually and live on social security.|||I really dont think your girlfriend is abusive like your friends are telling you. I do think however this relationship is not working for you. A relationship should havr the effect to enhance all aspects of your life, not just the relationship part of life. You should become a better person through your relationship because your partner makes you grow and flourish. You however, are giving up most parts of your life as a sort of sacrifice to keep the relationship part going. That's not how it should be... i think your boss is spot on. She's noy being a partner to you and you are not being a partner to her.Ask yourself and be honest: are you *happy* right now? Is this the relationship you would be happy with for the rest of your life?|||Yup, this is me as well. I also found BB easier as it actively rewards being aggressive instead of cautious and calculating. It gives the player much more leeway for mistakes, while DS is a waiting game where every step, every time you press the hit button, needs to be a calculated choice. Going too fast and loosing your patience gets you killed in DS, while aggressively 'dancing' with your enemies and keeping on your feet in BB is the way to go, even if it means an extra hit or two.|||Thanks!|||Thanks!|||Thanks!|||Ok, I'm going to give my honest opinion from the perspective of an TYPE_MENTION woman in a long term relationship with an TYPE_MENTION. Needless to saw, we have very different outlooks on life.I saw two things I want to point out from your post:This is a deal breaker for me and would also definitely a reason to break up with my partner over. Constant growth both inside the relationship and personal development outside of the relationship is paramount to me. From the very beginning I have told my SO (4+ years and counting) that once we stop growing, we are over. **HOWEVER**This is not OK from **your** side of the relationship. You are forcing your criteria of 'growth', 'success' and 'how it should be done' on your partner. It has nothing to do with you being critical, it has everything to do with you not being open for considering other types of growth, success and development as just as valid, right and true as your own definition of those things. I can read between the lines that maybe your SO also didn't have her own standards of growth, success and development (lack of hobbies, working for charity but hating it, etc). However, regardless, your frustration about how she didn't fit your framework of definitions is a real culprit here and you will have issues with this in any future relationships as well, if you don't open up. (EVEN if your future SO will also be an TYPE_MENTION.)Take my SO. He is not very ambitious in the sense how we as TYPE_MENTION look at ambitious. But he enjoys reading for example, but didn't grow up in a very educated family. One of his personal goals is to read more classic literature and he loves telling me about the books he read and what he learned from it. He also very much enjoys sports and he also very muchs enjoys telling me about how he *finally* was able to get through a specific exercise which he had trouble with before. He loves doing scientific research, but hates being a researcher. For him, his job (research) is about his love for the field, but he hates day to day life on the lab, which he can absolutely bitch about. He know he doesn't want to continue and become a professor for example, so personal growth for him is not becoming better at his job. Instead, personal growth for him is trying new things and trying to think of what kind of future job would suit him more, something that he doesn't hate as much, but still fires up his passion for research. My SO is very untidy, he 'simply isn't bothered by it' as he tells me. However, he knows I am, so he tries to clean up, although it will never be to my standards. Instead of being frustrated that he isn't doing it according to my standards, we appreciate his development in growing his empathy because he got way better over the years in anticipating when I am super stressed and really NEED a clean home, at which time he tries to help out even more. I am super grateful every single time I come home, and he made an honest effort, because he did it for me, not for himself.And I am very critical about him, and I push him very hard. But I am critical and pushy on **his** terms, not mine. My critique and pushiness needs to help him grow, his love and support of me needs to help me find my footing in day to day life so I can grow.|||That's really the only solution. Luckily you're CF, so you even have the money to actually buy two!|||I had a similar issue at your age. I was the 'this kid is good enough in practically all subjects to consider advancing further in it at university' but I also never knew what I particularly really liked or wanted to do.For me, I decided based on the following criteria:1. I wanted to earn a degree with more or less guaranteed job offers after I'd finish it.2a. I wanted to earn a degree that would be recognized all over the world. No fancy, fashionable new degree, but things like mathematics, psychology, or economics.2b. I wanted a degree that would allow for an international career. (At that point, I wasn't yet sure I wanted to become an expat, but anticipated I might, so a degree that allowed for this was crucial to keep that option open.)3. I highly preferred small class sizes and lots of in class lecture and tutorial houra, as I believed this aspect spoke to educational quality.4. I simply needed to have a feeling that I would actually enjoy the subject (like you, I did not particularly *like* physics or maths).From that short list, I decided that I would do either chemistry or chemical engineering. My uni offered a shared first year programme, so I could experience both before choosing. I chose chemical engineering.The thing is, I'm now doing my masters in chemical engineering and I have come to realize that I *definitely* do not want to make a career out of being an engineer. This means studying is a bit of chore, but oh well, in keep myself busy with interesting extra curriculars and language courses. The thing is, it doesn't matter that I don't want to be an engineer, because the engineering degree is a foot in the door to *loads* of different career paths, even stuff that will eventually lead to banking/finance or consultancy. I've received loads of interest from non engineering companies once I tell them I am specifically interested in a non engineering career path.So yeah, my advise would be to choose a degree that will give you good job prospects within that specific field, but that will also keep the door open for many other opportunities, once you figure out what you actually want to do with your life.|||Bij wie zit je zelf/zou je aanbevelen?|||It was actually a really valuable experience in terms of getting to know more about my body specifically. A standardized amount of sedative (be it epi or otherwise) will take me down way, way longer than the average person. For example, during my first surgery, I took 8 hours between placing the epi and being released from recovery to the ward, instead of the 4-5 hours they expected. However, a sedative also takes way longer to actually settle in my body. As in, 2-3x times the amount of time you'd expect. Having experienced this, I now can discuss with the surgeons that I require *less* sedatives, but that I should be brought to pre-op far earlier than a regular patient so they can place the sedative early so they can actually start the surgery on time. Being able to fine tune these things has led to far better recoveries in my subsequent surgeries.|||Because there is a natural progression from HSK1 through 6? I started with a HSK1 course, now on my way through HSK2 and if I keep this up I'll get to HSK6 in about 3 years. Good luck getting straight into reading characters and understanding grammar if you don't know the basics.|||Yeah. High B2/C1 would be my cutoff point in claiming any kind of fluency as well. I think many people underestimate the major gap between B2 and C1 in terms of language ability when it comes to handling real life conversations that go beyond the basic scenarios of ordering a pizza or whatever.|||Lady Mormont is like 11 years old or something. I don't think you can properly type children that young.|||My mother in law is amazing, probably a better mother to me than my own mother. She cares for and about me, is truly interested in me and is beyond generous. When someone told her she should be sad that her son is now living on his own and I 'took him from her', she called that person out and told that person 'why would I be sad? I gained a new amazing daughter.' I'm proud to say my boyfriend takes after her and is just as kind and generous. MILs can be amazing. Just need to pick the right SO with the right family attached.|||There is very little deviation in terms of income from the norm. The normal distribution of household income is incredibly narrow. Median income is about 32k/year, my SO and I, who will be both university educated in very in demand STEM fields when both working full time will be earning a household income of 60k/year. This puts us already at the very end of the normal distributions and this amount of money would make most Dutch people consider you 'rich'.For comparison, I looked this up some time for another discussion I had on this topic, if we'd live in the US, our household income would be over 150k dollars/year. Also, look at taxes. 32k/year after taxes leaves you about 25k/year. At 60k/year, our progressive taxes leaves about 39k/year. This also causes even high income families to live more middle class lifestyles. But then again, I gladly pay taxes. Healthcare insurance is 100euros/month with a max out of pocket of about 400 euros/year. Pensions are provided for, higher education only costs you 2k/year because the gov pays another 10k/year to the universities directly, government issued student loan systems currently at an interest of **0.01%** (!). Because of everyone having to conform to the norm, we have a very egalitarian society in terms of opportunity.|||In that case I must apologize. I read the lines on not wanting to change your lifestyle and needing a new car and got the feeling that your lifestyle was more luxurious than what you described in your reply just now. Considering this, I understand your feelings a lot better, as running a household on 1.5 salary simply doesn't seem feasable which is a justified concern.Your last sentence on each pulling equal weight and putting in equal effort even if this doesn't equate to equal salaries interests me though. Is it your finance that's the greater concern or this feeling?I think when discussing this topic with your partner it may be usefull to separate these two discussions. Finances are a purely rational matter and it would be easiest to discuss this as a purely rational problem without bringing the emotional feelings of pulling equal weight in your relationship into that same discussion. Both discussions need to be had though.I think at 7 years in you are also in your right to question him on choices such as getting even further into student debt, simply because after 7 years it's clear you're both in it for the long haul and *his* decision to get more debt direct affects your relationship and your household finances. But this is also part of the rational finance discussion and not the emotional troubles.|||Yup, learn the patterns. With every reaction and mechanism you need to ask yourself: why is this happening?With organic chemistry it has everything to do with electrons and how they behave and how they attack and break bonds. That's the pattern you need to figure out for yourself. Don't tell yourself: molecules of type X react with molecules of type Y in a way that Z happens, but tell yourself: molecules that have this fuctional group A have as a characteristic ability that group A leaves the molecule under the influence of B.|||I prefer classes, at least up until a solid B1 level. Classes provide a lot of structure and feedback of for example written work. Even at my HSK1 (Chinese) course my teacher encouraged us to write multiple little stories every week and she would correct every one of them in detail. Going to classes gives me a solid understanding of the basics of the language. Once you're at B1, for me, it's only a matter of reading *a lot* of books and newspapers to improve myself.|||Start reading! Get a book at your level, Harry Potter works wonders, and just read. Even if you don't get a 100% it doesn't matter, just read and when you come across the same word multiple times which you don't understand and it starts to bother you, look up what it means.|||First thing that came into mind, especially considering you only have a BSc while MSc *really* is the norm over here, is trying to find work in the London banking world. You have the rights credentials to be hired, but that world is absolutely brutal.. however, you also indicate you are looking for somethinh short term, so that might make it bearable. Also.. once you're here, a London-Paris flight is cheap and takes what? I'm guessing less than an hour really.. although the banking world doesn't really give you a lot of time off.|||What I did was take a couple of random tests, and not some trends.. Don't take the % of E vs I too seriously to begin with, but find out what's a constant for you, that's a good starting point. For me, it was the NT profile. Google on the word 'function' + a type and just start reading a lot. Find out how extraverted vs. introverted functions deal with how you *process* information, not deal with how sociable you are. For example, I'm an TYPE_MENTION, but very easily fatigued from social interaction and in that sense very introverted. Based on those function you can start thinking about whether you recognize those functions in your own life and how to made decisions, or see if you can recognize functions in the behaviour of others. Once you start getting how the functions work, and after applying a bunch of introspection, you can quite easily start to pinpoint your type. For the longest time, I got TYPE_MENTION due to my social exhaustion, but my function stack fits TYPE_MENTION much, much better.|||I have a general rule of thumb when it comes to these cases: if you value your relationship you have to accept there will be ups and downs. You are clearly in a down right now. If you value your relationship enough to want to work for it, give it 10% of your total relationship's length to work out your problems and decide whether it has improved enough to stay or not. In your case, you've been together for 5 years. Give it half a year in which you truly focus on making things better and reevaluate your position after that time has passed. Until then, try to leave the thoughts about leaving our of your head.|||Usually it's one big final exam which covers all material a few weeks or months after the course has ended. No additional lectures, you're by yourself to get your knowledge up to par. If you fail the retake you redo the whole course the next year. Assignments, papers and practicals are not that straight forward, they usually have a custom made resit option that fits the course and the mode of examination of that course. However, every course will allow you to resit one way or another.|||This is actually why I got a Midori notebook. It's a kind of notebook that fits multiple booklets. I like to split it the pure 'to do' stuff of the bullet journal and projects, more general lists, etc etc physically.|||Hahaha, if there is anything I learned over the years and meeting lots of people with vastly different sexualities, it's that sexuality is a spectrum along quite a few axes. When I consider the gay-straight axis, I am indeed super straight as I seriously feel no attraction to other women, which is also quite a bit different than normal, as I find that most people, even if they identify as straight, usually do feel *some* kind of attraction to people of their own gender. I simply don't at all.|||Are you American? In that case, I think it might actually be really interesting for you, especially because Americans are used to/don't mind traveling for long distances, or, at least, what we Europeans call long distances. If you come to the Netherlands, there are a lot of interesting sites to visit within a couple of hours driving distance. You could even split a trip into two. Spend some days in Berlin, then come to Amsterdam for example. But if you are interested in WW2, I think it will be very interesting for you to experience the Remembrance of the Dead. This is the ceremony in Amsterdam from 2015: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ogb2ZNNIwII get that it's in Dutch, but the essence of it is that different people (our king and queen, members of dutch parliament, generals from the army, navy and airforce, old WW veterans, decedents from war victims, and a lot more) place flowers to remember certain groups of war victims. After that, a trumpet player plays the Dutch version of *The Last Post* and the two minutes of silence starts. The end of the two minutes is signaled when an orchestra starts playing our national anthem. It's an incredible experience, and it shows the impact a world war can have on a country, even 70 years after it finished.|||It's just different standards I guess. A family of 4 would be more than happy with a home or appartment of 120 square meters.|||I read your original story when you posted it. Great to read an update! So glad it all worked out and you got to take the cat with you. Kitty is absolutely adorable!|||500 on my first try. I had issues with Indian (?) related languages. I couldd recognize Hindi, but languages like Telugu, Urdu and Tamil are totally unfamiliar to me.I'm pretty sure I can identify all European languages. I can also distinguish most Slavic languages from non Slavic languages and distinguish the major Slavic languages from each other. I can distinguish Mandarin from any of the other dialects, but wouldn't be able to distinguish the dialects themselves. Most major Asian languages like Hindi and Thai I would probably be able to somewhat recognize, especially in a game setting like this. I would not know where to start with any of the African languages (besides Arabic and Afrikaans).Hurray for studying at a highly international university and hearing about 5 different languages in passing on any normal day.|||She can't if she's actually also a Turkish national. If you have multiple nationalities, national law prevails over international law in this case and you can't ask for help of an embassy in a country where you also hold citizenship yourself.|||One of my dream techs that would be needed to get transhumanism to its full potential would in my opinion be 'brain chips' that allow neural control of technologies and interfaces. I can definitely see neuroscience being useful in that regard.|||I started of on the right track due to my fathers influence when I had to choose what to study. I'm Dutch and here, you don't do 'college', you pick a field and study that for 4-6 years (depending on the field) to get your masters with only classes specific to your field, no general ed. My father told me: you need to pick something you can find work with above choosing the thing you love. Choose what's useful, will make you money and is something you *like*, this will give you the freedom to pursue stuff you'll love along side your career later on in life, without hating your career. Together with my dad I set up several criteria based on which I chose my major:1. Good to excellent job perspectives. 2. An 'old school' field that would be recognizable world wide. 3. Small scale education with relatively few students in every class. In the end, I chose chemistry and switched to chemical engineering after about 6 months (my uni offered this option without any study delays). After my first year, I was bored and picked up a second degree in industrial engineering, with a specialization in process production. Next to that, I picked up a lot of extra curricular stuff, just to get my feelers out. I organized activities for my association, bar tended at a local student bar, got involved in educational quality improvement, started to learn Mandarin, and a bunch more. Dutch higher education is really interesting. By law, most managerial layers (programme level, faculty and even university wide) need to have student *board* members, yes this means a 20-something year student will have the opportunity to sit on the board of the fucking university for a year. In my second year I got involved in this world of student politics, because I had all my feelers out and did so many random things already and got to know so many different people, who got to know me as well. One of those people approached me about an application coming up and told me I should apply because they thought I might like it. So I did. And it was the best choice of short life up till now.Here is the thing: I'm now a few years in with several of these board positions behind me. I found the thing I *love* on these boards... Which is long term strategic management. I also found out what my absolute strong point is: which is understanding, problem shooting and shaping organizational structures. These are things I was lucky to find out in my 20s, opposed to my 30s or 40s which would be a normal age to get into some heavy management roles. This is where my dad comes in: he got me into engineering. And engineering will get me into the work force with fast track management traineeships, no fucking questions asked. I love tech and I'm a decent engineer.. but I would hate to be an engineer the rest of my life. But it doesn't matter, because now, my engineering degree is a means to an end, a foot in the door to something I love and excel at which no longer is directly engineering related. On top of that, I have a network full of senior management people who like me and have outright told me that they are willing to actively approach their own network and endorse me to companies or universities I like. Several of my predecessors used their network to get into Stanford, Oxford and the like for their masters or PhDs, others are now working good jobs at several multinationals. Honestly, the last couple of years of my life have been an amazing roller coaster ride, but at the moment I feel like all my ducks are lined up and I honestly couldn't have a better start at my 'grown up' life.|||These comments are really interesting.. wow. I'd never tought these kind of things aren't regulated in the US. In my country, you would be able to do something, as by law, there needs to be an independent 'exam committee' who judges over such cases and *not* the professor him/herself. In this case, you'd have a very strong case, as long as the exam was of high enough quality and level to test your abilities. This would be considered the fault of the teacher, which can't be passed on to the students. Even if the exam committee would declare you'd need to retake it, you are required by law to have the option to appeal, which kicks your case to a university wide independent committee who deals with appeal cases. I've been on that committee as a student.. they often judge in favour of the student, as long as the student can proof no fault. (And even if you don't agree with the appeals committee, you can even take it to a special official judicial court for higher education.)|||Although outright advertising is really annoying, I did find the 'store X is having an amazing deal on Y' posts very useful. Maybe consider making a weekly/monthly/sticky thread where users can post these deals to which they can refer in their further comments on different parts of the sub.|||It's the classic case of the \\\"I am your mother and I have the right to be a part of your life and the decisions you make because I birthed you!\\\" charade.|||My SO is also struggling with depression. I wish you could really feel and understand that I *really* am lucky and happy to have him, because like you said, he's such a strong person for fighting this battle and wanting to get better. I love him for it, but he can't seem to understand it's a strength (and something to admire) instead of a weakness.|||Does your guy have an interest in beards? My guy had the same problem and was awfully sad and insecure about the whole issue. We were joking about him doing the 'No shave November' hype and he did. When November passed he asked if I'd mind if he'd continue growing his beard. Despite balding genetics he grew an amazing big, full beard which he is incredibly proud of.|||Maybe you should email the Italian embassy anyway. I had a similar issue with my mother who was originally Yugoslavian, but never registered herself again after the fall of Yugoslavia. I was also born after the fall, and never got registered as a citizen to one of their ex-Yugoslavian countries. When I became an adult, I sought out Serbian nationality, and after a lot of pulling back and forth with the embassy as I couldn't get my nationality approved based on lineage laws, they figured out I actually *could* get the Serbian nationality in the end by applying through some really obscure diaspora law that grants citizenship to those who can proof they are part of the Serbian ethnic group. I handed in my birth certificates and those of my family on mothers side, proving I had a full matrilineal line of Serbian people, and handed in some other 'proof' such as my baptism certificate of the local Orthodox church (yup, it was this document that actually made the difference in the end). I needed *a bunch* of trips up and down to the embassy to get everything sorted, because I was seriously the first person the people working at the embassy (they got the old, experienced guys to handle my request) to have ever claimed citizenship based on this law, so they were as confused as I was. Anyway, it worked. Just applied for my passport, should be here in another week or two.|||Most other western countries have a system in place where high school is separated in different levels, and only the highest level gives you entrance to uni, that's why they don't need a 'foundation year' when students start at uni, because all have the same higher level background. Also: no colleges, you pick a major and study that major from day one, no liberal arts stuff and studying random courses during your first year, that what high schools are for.|||Your comment is quite manipulative as your example is arguably not an example of the general statement in your first sentence. You could very well argue that not being able to pay to fix your car is in your control, but you're in this situation because of bad financial planning.. in that case you could just take the bus, or carpool. However, if your car broke down on your way to work and you give your employer a call that you'll run late, the employer can't fire you because the fact that the car broke down *on that moment* which caused you to run late *is* something that's out of your control.However, examples like /u/Wootery gave are much better, these are actually cases which you couldn't have anticipated.|||I think it's due to womens identity being tied to motherhood in our society. A woman is expected to be the main caretaker and should bear that burden without questioning it. While men.. well.. what really changes for men in their life when they have a kid? They have a wife to take care of that, no?For example, in my country, loads of women work part time and we see a trend of lots of men starting to work part time as well to care for the children. I think this is great for the children and is also a good thing in terms of societal changes towards gender equality, but what bugs me is how people say 'oh, John won't be here Friday, Fridays are his *daddy days*'. People actually call it that. Men don't parent, no, they just take a day off to babysit.|||TYPE_MENTION female in a long term relationship with an TYPE_MENTION guy. My SO does not feel intimidated by my personality and simply *trusts* me to be faithful to him, just like I trust him. (Yeah, a totally weird and foreign concept in a relationship, I know.)We often talk about how in our relationship, we give each other all the freedom of the world (within monogamous constraints) but we still choose to spend most of our time together because we make each other grow. The moment we stop growing or the moment my SO tries to even rein in my freedom a tiny bit, I **will** be gone. He knows this. I've told him, repeatedly, and will continue to tell him every 6 months or so.   |||I have a Midori and use exactly the system you described. My Midori holds 3 notebooks, one 'to-do' bullet journal style notebook, one collections notebook used for meeting notes, planning agendas for meetings, mapping ideas and projects and a last notebook which is a blank one and serves as a random quick notes/calculations page. For me, it works absolutely perfectly. The only thing to consider when thinking about getting a Midori is it's rather peculiar size. It's a bit smaller than regular A5, I personally love it, especially for bullet journaling as it forces you to be to the point and not write long eloborate sentences if you want to keep the one line, one tast format. However, because of the irregular size, you might have trouble finding inserts. I find the Midori inserts too expensive personally. Over at /r/notebooks not a lot of people agree with me, but I really like Moleskine notebooks. I get the large sized cahiers and use a paper cutter to trim a cm or so from the side so they fit. Really easy to do as well.|||Babies actually don't fit through the birth canal properly for most money, but the baby needs to get out one way or another. What happens? Your skin literally rips to make room for the baby. First thing that happens to a lÃ³t of women after pushing the child out is not holding the child but getting surgical stitches down there.|||Especially considering we are talking about the Dutch.. I am generalizing a bit, but the Dutch are not that family orientated as many other European cultures (Spanish, Italian). For example, many grandmothers refuse to be a 'babysit grandma' (oppasoma) as in having to take care of the baby for a set amount of days every week, because 'it's your child, you take care of it, I did my job raising you already'. These kind of attitudes are unfathomable for many people from other cultures... To expect a rather distant Dutch relative to just take you in no questions asked is not a reasonable expectation at all.|||This is exactly why I don't want kids. I don't hate kids, they're actually quite OK.. I wouldn't even *mind* having a kid myself IF I could make sure it would be a kind, polite, highly intelligent and also an introvert kid. In that case, I guess I would even enjoy having a kid, because the kid would be fine on his/herself and wouldn't interfere with my wishes to travel the globe and have a kick ass career. In any other case: I'd be miserable. But just like in the post: it would be like getting a lottery ticket, while expecting the actually win the lottery.|||Wel now you've met one. When I was in primary school my teacher refused to allow me to go to a pre university high school necessary to get a diploma to get a university education (dutch educational systems are a bit difficult) even though my standardized test scores where top notch and higher than all the boys who got pre univerisity recommendations. My parents made a scene and everything got resolved. When I got into high school, I had my maths teacher tell me not to go for the more difficult math classes which were a requirement for STEM degree admissions because she thought I wouldn't pass them, even though my grade averages where higher than those of several boys who did get her recommendation. I didn't listen to the teacher, did the more difficult maths classes anyway. Now I'm at university, doing a *double* engineering degree. The school system as failed me time and time again, I was very lucky to have a supportive father who stood by my side fighting these battles.|||Just a tip if you decide to come back to the EU and work.. if you say you're fluent in a language (for example on your CV), people *do* assume C2 over here.

Although with CS it isn't a necessity because of labour shortages in that area, it is an amazing way of getting an easy visa and transition to an employment visa as you'll be able to find a job whilr actually being in the country. Also, consider exchanges during your undergrad, usually it is easy to arrange something, even if they are no official programmes between your uni and the one youre interested in of you are willing to do the leg work and get everything arranged on your own.|||Question if you don't mind: I've been looking for companies which offer this. In your experience, if they have it, do they openly advertise it or is it more 'under the radar' in which they cherry pick the candidates?If it is openly advertised.. do you have some google search key words for me? I'm having trouble finding these programmes in my industry of choice.|||It's probably because of the roman alphabet vs. characters. I think however, written language is the base for any language. If you can't read it, you won't be able to fully internalize the language. Besides, learning to read characters have helped me immensely. There are so many homophones in Mandarin and learning characters helps you order these homophones based on their characters. Especially once you realize that many characters have a 'phonetic radical' which indicates pronunciation.|||It doesn't bother me very much, not since I experienced what is what like to deal with executive managers on a daily basis, and realized that keeping an agenda is a *very* fluid business if they are as complex and demanding as theirs. Since that experience, I became very easy with scheduling on the go and stopped feeling any scheduling related stress I did before. There is one big exception though, especially when it comes to informal, friendly relationships. I absolutely don't respect it when people drop plans last minute when they *know* I have put effort into preparing for our plans, for example, if we planned for dinner together and they drop the plans 30 minutes before it's scheduled while I already did all shopping and while I'm already making dinner. I don't care if you cancel the day before, or even the same morning, but there comes a point where the effort has been put in after which I'm not OK with it anymore. Whether I will still be friends with that person would depend on whether the person would put in immediate effort to reschedule.|||I prefer not to think about and analyze loving someone like I do with everything else in my life. Love is just love, and it can be something amazing that can just be experienced without needing am explanation.So what does love mean to me? It means happiness that seemingly is there without cause. It means having a home. It means having a person in your life which makes life better than when you're alone. It means knowing that whatever happens there will be someone you can count on to be there for you. It means being exposed and fragile, but feeling safety because of it, instead of fear.I reality it's just a neurochemical reactions that makes me feel this way. But if we talk about what it means to me as a person: love simply makes me happy and makes life better. And that's why I treasure it. I don't need a deeper or more complicated emotional or social explanations than that.|||Depending on what kind of lab you work on, that can go *really* wrong. Normal glasses aren't as strong and resistant as safety glasses, plus many models  don't cover enough area around your eyes.|||I get that the US legal system is a snake hole, but to answer: if this would happen where I live and they can't/won't pay, OP can claim that amount from the estate once her parents die. (Our country also has laws that children per definition at miminum should receive x% of the estate and that this percentage os to be divided evenly among all children. Parents are by law unable to disown their children and give all the money to one child only).Like I said, I don't think this is the way to go, but it is an interesting thought.|||I'm Dutch, but grew up with English from a young age as my mother was raised in Australia and she wasn't fluent in Dutch when I grew up. I study at a Dutch university, but my degree programme is in English. Nowadays I speak English more often than Dutch.|||Same for us. What helps me with the antsy feeling is to not associate the date night time as time that could equivalently be spend on work. If there is a big deadline coming up, I made myself practice over the last couple of years that I should blame myself for not having managed my time, instead of feeling like I *could have* spend those date night hours on work. No, you can't exchange one for the other, so that thought isn't allowed, there simply is *too little time* to finish in time for the deadline so figure out what to do with the work time you have left, instead of having an internal argument about whether it's right to prioritize these hours for something silly like watching a movie instead of working.|||If you want to work as a nurse in the Netherlands you need to be registered,  just like doctors who work in the Netherlands. You would need to figure out whether you can do this without further schooling in the Netherlands. On top of that, I seriously doubt you'd have any chance working as a nurse without a very strong command of the Dutch language. People say Dutch is easy, but to get on a solidly decent (not even fluent) level which will make you able to work in such a job environment that's so heavily based on communicational skills, most with a university level educational background would take 2-3 years of weekly classes to get there.|||I think you put the difference down perfectly: a broad general STEM basis for all students in the US, especially heavy on the maths side, vs. a more specific approach in Europe at the cost of a strong back ground in those basic STEM skills. I studied Chemistry back in the day before switching to Chemical Engineering. Chemistry has a perfect example of this: chemistry students only get the maths courses 'Calculus for Chemistry' and 'Linear Algebra for Chemistry' at my uni and these courses aren't even taught by professors but just lecturers. It's the most basic of the basic, doesn't even teach the full background of the maths but only applications relevant for chemistry. But then again, all our first year Chemistry students will know after their first year how to make and interpret NMR spectra, becauses they've done about 50 of them during practicals, while many PhD students from abroad haven't even touched or seen an NMR in real life. Edit: by the way, this makes me realise why so many US STEM students have so much trouble getting their degree! In my country probably only the physicists and of course the mathematicians themselves would get Calc1-3 and LinAlg1-3, it's certainly not for everyone to be able to handle those courses!|||I'm so happy! This week, I made the jump and put a significant amount of my savings (10k!! which seriously is a lot of money for me) into an ETF to start my journey to FI. It was really quite scary to be honest, but now, a few days later, I'm fine and ready to start playing for the long run.|||I'm quite active on some MBTI related subs and have been reading up on it quite heavily over the years. I'll give you some personal reasons why I think MBTI has value.First off, I agree MBTI does not have any scientifically proven predicative power. There are tests that do this job a lot better, like the Big Five, even though Big Five has its own issues. However, what I like about MBTI is not the 'personality description' part of it, but how MBTI uses functions to describe how people process information, how they see the world and how they interact with it. I think we can all agree that people deal with the world around them very differently. Some people think in images, some in abstracts, some base their thoughts on looking back to past experiences, some base their thoughts on looking forward based on possible but unknown opportunities. When I started reading up on MBTI I realized that my personal way of thinking is very, very specific and definitely not the norm. (Which in all honesty, *I did not truly and fully realize up until that point!*) I realized there is a whole range of way people can possibly think and interact with the world, some of which are so radically different to my ways that I can barely imagine actually thinking like that.I used MBTI as a tool to read up on other types and used to to learn about radically other ways of thinking. Seeing where they overlap with my way, seeing where they are different and how that affects a person's outlook on life.It's been a great ongoing thought experiment through which I learn a lot about other people and which gives me a framework to be more empathic to people who are different to me. It made me able to appreciate and respect people more, who I before simply didn't *get* at all, people who I considered to be incompetent and bad at their job etc, simply because I didn't realize and understand their way of thinking.In addition to understanding others better, MBTI also gave me a tool to evaluate my own personality. When your own way of thinking and interaction is suddenly one of many, to you get to be able to compare yourself to others, see where your strength but especially your own weaknesses lie. Studying and using MBTI made me a better, well rounded and more mature individual.This 'relational' part of MBTI is something quite unique to the popular personality tests available today. This for example cannot be done with Big Five, as there is no framework that explains Conscientiousness *in relationship to* Neuroticism for example.|||It's a difficult situation, because when a woman 'opts out' (as in, having an abortion), she claims her right to bodily autonomy. Men have this right as well, but it simply doesn't help them in this specific case. When we talk about men 'opting out' we usually talk about the combination of: 1. Relinquishing parental rights.2. Not having to pay child support.These are two very different issues however. Both men and women have the option to relinquish parental rights, either through adoption (relinquishing rights of both parents), or not acknowledging the child (in the case of the father) or coming to a legal arrangement in which the mother gives up her parental rights to the child and gives sole rights to the father. The mother giving up her rights to her child in favour of the father is something that doesn't happen often, but is key I believe in understanding this issue, because it shows that both men and women have equal rights in this regard.However, the true issue for most men is paying child support for a child they do not want. This however, in my opinion, is not part of 'opting out' of bringing a child in this world. The child exists through cause and effect directly linked to you and the child has rights, just as adult men and women do. Child support has everything to do with providing that what is needed to sustain the child's rights and very little to do whether you want to be a parent or not. In the case of the mother giving up her parental rights to the father, the mother would - just like the father if roles are reversed - need to pay child support. So also in this regard, I believe rights are equal. That being said: the true issue in my opinion is not equal rights to 'opt outs' but a lack of options in terms of anti-conception for men. I believe men who are angry about this issue, shouldn't worry themselves about 'financial abortions' but instead worry about increasing anti-conception methods for men.|||Both universities and 'Schools for Higher Education' offer BSc/BA/MSc/MA degrees in Europe. However, they are not equal in level or difficulty, as universities offer academic education and schools offer professional education. The USA does not have this system, but calls everything universities/colleges. When I Google integrated design, I find both universities that offer it (Technical **university** Delft, in the Netherlands) and also schools for higher education (Technische **Hochschule** KÃ¶ln). Obviously, a institution that offers professional education will very likely be more open to accept professional experience for credits.|||Thanks for your thorough response, I like reading about all the different systems in higher education and your response was super clear in explaining things! Seems OP might be in luck after all.|||Wanted to post the same. Your feelings are actually quite normal and there are loads of people who share them, even without a background of abuse. I like that sub, it's a kind sub to discuss these feelings with people who feel the same without the social stigma of it being 'unnatural' and 'wrong'.|||I feel like sharing part of my comment on another thread about someone who was very insecure about their depression and what her SO might think of her.No, depression is not beautiful but to me, if there is beauty to be found, it's this: those who struggle with depression are amazing an strong people, because beneath the ugly surface there is a beautiful person, fighting to make that beauty shine through one day. A beauty they sometimes even forget is there once the depression gets too tight of a grip..|||I'll just throw my question out there, just trying to understand: What exactly is it that makes you less comfortable in a 'straight' bar? And what makes a bar 'explicitly LGBT friendly?'|||Ok, for me, I need weeklies. The thing is, I *do* have a lot going on, so at any given point I have about 20 to do points open. I'm not going to rewrite all those 20+ points every single day.. And the problem is, although all those points need to be handled... a to do like 'hand in this paper TODAY because of deadline' is way more time sensitive than 'order Christmas present for mom' to name something random ... although even ordering a present *can* become time sensitive because of delivery times, some if I keep putting off doing this task, at one point I'd migrate it to a specific day as an ultimate deadline. And with just dailies, the lack of being able to prioritize is really making the 'traditional' bujo method unusable for me without a weekly.|||Thanks for taking time to reply, this community is really nice.I guess the thing that confuses me is how everyone is up and about when it comes to 'losing' coins. I get that there may be exchanges that will list 2X as BTC, so when you buy new coins through the exchange you might get duped, but how can this happen with existing coins you own the private key of?I mean. If you have coins prefork, and you want to send coins to whatever address on either of the two, it's my understanding that this transaction and your new balance will be written on that specific fork on the block chain. But in that case, the original balance will still hold for the other part of the fork right? Meaning if I were to accidently send something over a 2X block chain, it won't be written on the BTC block chain. I'm guessing this is what they mean with no replay protection, that somehow, it actually does get written on both block chain, but it confuses me how.|||Hahaha, this is great. I started my comment before there were any comments in this thread, but put my phone away before finishing my post. I only read your post after posting my own. We practically posted the exact same comment, just with different words to explain ourself.|||For me, that would not be acceptable. Look, I do believe a relationship should enhance your life, but shouldn't be the sole reason for your life to be good. I think everyone should have friends and be happy with their life and themselves regardless of relationship status.But when I think about my relationship (now 3.5+ years, close to your age as well), I realize my life would be absolutely fine without my SO, but being with him makes my life simply even *so much better*.Hearing you talk about your relationship makes me sad. Especially because in non of your comments you actually explain why you are in this relationship and how it is beneficial for you.|||Ah, I get it. When you said NT2 in combination with the government exam I assumed you talked about the 'staatsexamen programma II' which is the NT2 government exam on level B2, because those are the certificates you need to apply for university etc. But I get you are actually going beyond the regular NT2-II exam, which is really great!|||I actually recently started a new dedicated notebook! I'm a student, working really hard to build up a network. I'm involved with a few niche clubs, societies and organizations that often organize lectures with influential people within their field. These lectures are usually held for a small audience and I noticed the speakers often hand out their personal contact information *because* the lecture if for a specific small audience. Also, many interesting people attend those lectures and usually there are drinks afterwards. I started a notebook in which I 'collect' interesting people: their name, when and where I saw them, some key points of what they talked about, their contact information or contact information of those I know will have that persons contact info. Each person has it's own page full of data and details.This way, if I ever need an in in a certain field I can just look up relevant people in my notebook and give them a call and have an opening to start the conversation.|||This was one of the first things I checked as well after reading this post, but apparently Albania gives a special status to US passport holders which allows them to stay visa free for up to a *year*.

I usually study multiple at once (Chinese and French at the moment), but I already know quite a few and work and study in a multilingual environment. In my case, my head is already constantly switching languages, which makes it a lot easier.|||Yep, that's it. For me its the perfect way to cut down all my notebooks to just one notebook (the midori) but still have the feeling of having separate booklets with separate functions.|||You will have to figure out what subject you want to study. There is no 'general ed' college system in Europe. You choose a topic, for example, mathematics, philosophy or Danish language and culture, and that will be the topic you will study from day one for rest of the duration of your bachelors (with the exemption of maybe a few elective courses). As you can imagine, admission requirements will probably be different for mathematics than for Danish language and culture.|||Do you have a BSc of MSc? MSc is highly preferable although mathmaticians are always in demand, especially in financing fields (in the Netherlands at least). You might want to consider looking up recruitment agencies that cater especially to these specialized fields and simply cold call them.|||In de afgelopen 10 jaar is het systeem 3x veranderd.

If you find something similar in Germany and are interested in my universiity, I can find you the right email addresses to write to and the proper Dutch equivalents to name in your email to see whether they'd accept it.|||My father taught me not to give a shit about what other think and to stay true to myself, that's why I ended up in STEM in the first place. I don't care if I'm called a misogynist. I applaud everyone who is actively contributing to a more egalitarian society, because it takes courage, even more so when dealing with issues that touch upon sexism against men.|||Your comment just made me reconsider trying to get back to sci-fi books. I read a lot (*a lot*) of sci-fi and fantasy when I was a child and young adult and I loved it. I'm talking over probably 40 books a year here. I stopped for some reason when I was about 14 years old. I read very little now, but what I do read are biographies of influential people in politics, science and technology to immerse myself into the visions and ideas those people have for our world and our society. I love being confronted with totally new and weird and unheard of ideas for mankind. Your comment made me realize there are probably a lot of sci-fi books out there that are trying to do the same. If you know any, would you care to recommend some titles to me?|||If only there were an exact list. If you want another example just like Poland: the United States. Many of the other countries don't use that exact wording however, but in the end, they mean the same. In all of those cases however, those laws followed from [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_Nationality_Rule) Convention, the 'Master Nationality Rule'. It essentially says: If you hold nationalities A and B and you are in the territory of A, then B cannot claim you as their citizen and grant you diplomatic help. Government A in that case can effectively claim nationality A as your sole nationality and you effectively have to surrender any rights granted by your nationality B. That's why many countries have laws that require you to enter with the passport of that country if you have one, because as soon as you cross the border you can no longer claim to be 'nationality B' citizen so it makes no sense to enter as 'nationality B' citizen on a visa.|||You just described how I want my life to look like in 30 years. Thank you for sharing, this makes me happy thinking about how amazing life will be and how much I have to look forward to. :)|||I know 7 different EU languages at various levels, several at C1/C2, the level at which I consider someone to be fluent in a foreign language.. If anything, compared to the general population, I'm an expert in learning new languages, and the only way I could get from 0 to C1 in 3 years would be if I did a very intensive (several times a week) teacher-guided course in a language similar to a language I already have fluency in. For example, I could do Italian in 3 years, knowing French and Latin already. I can't do Mandarin in 3 years. How you can expect for example someone with Arabic as his/her mother language and very little other language exposure to learn a Romance/Germanic language to fluency in 3 years is beyond me.|||I think you should consider if the amount of happiness you are getting from being in this relation is enough for you to justify staying. You know he following:1. The child is not going away2. He has an active parenting role in this child's life. (Which he should!)3. Chosing to stay with this guy is chosing to be involved in the life of his child. They come as a package deal or not at all.4. A child will *always* have top priority because it's your goddamn child and that's how it should be.Knowing this, think about how it impacts your relationship and whether you'd still be happy 10 or even 20 years further down the line. Some people actually like the idea of being involved in a childs life and draw great happiness from it! Just the same some don't. There is no right or wrong, only your own personal feelings.I'm a huge believer of the idea that if you're in a serious relationship you should be able to see yourself with this person long term. If you don't, cut your losses and move on. Your not doing both a favour by struggling along for even more years as the outcome will be the same.|||What if you don't talk about time frames? When my boyfriend goes out I usually only ask him whether I should stay up for him to come home, meaning will he be back before or after about half past midnight.Both answers are fine, because when I know what to expect I couldn't care less if he came home at 1 or at 4, I'll be sleeping anyway. This way you turn the question around and make it about you instead of about him.Edit: one exception, if he told me he'd be home before bed and he'll be staying out longer because he's having fun, I DO require him to app me. But that's just a respect issue. I don't care if he wants to stay out longer, if he's having fun, he should stay longer, but he can't let me stay up waiting for him if he does.|||Your post hit me quite hard. I needed to read this. I'm in my 20s and living with my boyfriend of almost 5 years. He is so kind and simply in many, many ways an amazing man and person. Our communication and collaboration in our relationship is superb.Lately however I got caught up in my frustrations of him not being there for me in the way I need when I'm trying to walk my mind through sudden, emotional and stressful situations. I guess I simply have a very specific, highly rationalized way of dealing with moments like those. At one point I got all teared up and mad at him out of frustration of him not helping me sort out my mind in the way that I do. My dad does however, so I told him it made me sad that I intuitively call my dad at such moments, instead of him. We talked through it, and indeed we came to the conclusion that although this is the way I function, he simply does not know or have the ability to help me in that specific way on the kind of level I need. This does not mean he doesn't support me, nor that he wouldn't do anything in his power to help me. He simply thinks rather differently than me when it comes to stressful problems, and as such, deals with them differently. And that's ok, because like you said, there is not a single person in this world that will be able to be able to offer exactly what you need from others in your life in all issues that you may come across in life.|||Thanks for the quick respond, at least I know I'm not going insane! :)|||I'll be making a comparison between me (TYPE_MENTION, COGFUNC_MENTION dom) and my SO (TYPE_MENTION, COGFUNC_MENTION dom) and how we study. We are both in STEM. My SO *loves* learning. He is the ultimate knowledge sponge. Everything he gets taught enters this unbelievable web of knowledge he holds in his head and every new piece if info will be given a space in which it's linked through logic to everything else he knows. My SO is in Chemistry, and he excells in intuitively finding the logic between for example a very difficult synthesis route taught during advanced masters degree course to fundamental thermodynamics he was taught as a first year, while during the masters course, there would be zero talk about thermodynamics during the masters course. Because of this, my SO is beyond intelligent. He can at any given notice still tell you what he has learned 5 years ago, good enough to teach the subject. However, he is damn awful in doing exams in which he is forced to demonstrate his knowledge in a certain set way. So, I'm an COGFUNC_MENTION dom and I study Chemical Engineering with a heavy Chemistry background. I am very much academically successful because to me, like some other user already said, my goal is not the simply gain knowledge, but to solve a problem or goal. This can be either passing the course or getting my degree. I didn't choose ChemEng because I love ChemEng but because I need this degree to get the type of job I want. So. While my SO goes to his lectures and sits there absorbing all the knowledge thats put in front of him, I can sit in the same lecture and will be busy trying the understand the logic *the lecturer* is using, making logical frameworks of how the course is build up, instead od my own. Trying the figure out how the teacher thinks, so I can perform in the same line of reasoning during an exam etc. I do not have any *intrinsic* hunger for knowledge, I *use* knowledge to achieve my goals.|||Yeah, that is what I was trying to convey (also see the note in the parentheses), but I agree it didn't come across like I wanted.

However, they have one specific service that makes it all worth it: every (and I mean *every*) single item they sell is measured in house and tried on by several employees with different body types. As such, each item will have their own unique measurement charts (even if it's clothes from the same brand) with additional advice for when you fall in between measurements or when a garment specifically simply doesn't work for specific body types. On top of that, their prices are simply fair, not the cheapest, but very, very fair and if you do send stuff to be returned it's dealt with swiftly with great customer support. With that kind of service, it don't care spending some euros on a return.|||Cool, thanks for your reply. It seems opinions are divided.

I highly recommend it, it's pretty good.Anyway, I also think this story explains why maybe sometimes we are too harsh on expecting society not to bingo us at all. I mean. Like you said, this shit only happened 60 years ago. Our (older) grandparents actually lived through life where indeed having children was NOT a choice, it was simply very much a fact of life. It's our parents who are the first generation to grow up with even just the possibility to choose having children or not. The people who raised our parents didn't have that freedom of choice, a mindset which they probably passed down to their children.We are the first generation *raised* by parents who themselves lived their whole life knowing they have this choice and possibly freedom.Bingos are fucking stupid. But putting this (very recent) development in society in a more historical context, I *get* why society hasn't yet adjusted to a new frame of mind where children are 100% a choice, instead of a given.|||I'm Dutch, our educational system is very tiered in vocational schools (at different levels), applied universities and research universities.

I agree a university bachelor should be an entry degree, it will take a long while before our society adjusts to it.|||I agree with this, however, we all know women in science, especially STEM face unique difficulties compared to the male population.

I've had my share of male students say 'but equality and what about us?!' and I tell them the same every time and I'm totally honest and not sarcastic when saying this: 'I was missing this at our faculty for women, if you feel you are missing something similar for men, go ahead and set it up! I'll help you and put you in touch with the right people'. At that point all the guys suddenly aren't interested anymore..|||Yeah, that's exactly the trick. If you are a citizen of EU country X, and you want to take your non-EU partner to settle in country X, you are to abide by the (often much stricter) national immigration laws. But if you as citizen of country X decide to move to EU country Y, under the EU freedom of movement law, you can bring your non-EU partner over to *also* settle under EU freedom of movement laws, which are very lenient. Frankly, you seriously only need to be able to show a marriage certificate when you cross the border to country Y *together* with your non-EU partner, and that country is required to grant the partner entry. The non-EU partner would not be able to travel the EU on their own, and would be bound to you, but they can legally come over and stay at country Y. You will have issues when you decide to relocate back to your home country X, as in that case, national laws will again kick in.|||This is actually good news I guess, countries with mandatory schooling have rather extensive special education programmes and schools. If she's able to attend school in the States, you most certainly will be able to find a suitable school in Germany as well, although you might want to find a suitable school in advance and make sure you'll find housing nearby. Living in a village and adding large commutes to the one suitable school closer to a city can be quite a burden. All of this can be done from the States, though. Other topics you'd might want to consider: health insurance and living close to places with large (university?) medical centres, depending on what kind of care your daughter needs.Once you get German health insurance, it might very well include the in-home care you are getting now, but it might require having your child supervised by a German medical specialist. That specialist might very well need to prepare several documents and such (and thus, having seen and examined her several times) before he'll be able to discuss her needs with the insurance company.. there may be some weeks/months in which you'll be lacking in in-home care. About the above: I'm really just thinking out loud.. I'm not sure about any of this, but I can imagine this things might show up as potential problems.|||If you can get in on a spouse visa, things will be pretty straight forward. You do a simple Dutch culture test at the embassy, rather simple though.. it's not even at A1 level and you just need to know some basic phrases and words + general knowledge of the Netherlands.Once you get here, you go through a period called 'inburgering'. I believe this is a period of about 3 years in which you must pass certain tests, the main test is a Dutch language test. I would really like to stress you take the NT2 language test, it's the toughest but it gives you B2 language qualifications which will also allow you to get for example an education in the Netherlands. The government organizes these language courses (though I believe you do still need to pay for them) so you won't have to worry about finding a place to take the course.Also, have look at this link: https://ind.nl/EN/individuals/residence-wizard/family/marriageIND is the government organization that handles all these kind of things, the website will have all the information it needs.Also have a look at this one as well: https://ind.nl/EN/individuals/residence-wizard/dutch-citizenship/naturalisation\\\"You are married to a Dutch citizen. If you are married and you have been living together for an uninterrupted period of 3 years you can then apply for naturalisation (this is also possible when living abroad). The 3-year term also applies when you are an unmarried partner of a Dutch citizen and you have lived together for at least 3 years continuously.\\\"|||Haha! I must say, I kind of agree with how the company handled this situation. Although a bit extreme, they taught those interns a very important lesson: the world won't bend over backwards for you. And frankly, internships are supposed to be part of your education.. better they receive an attitude check now, opposed to when they actually work in the field, make this mistake and ruin their chances of finding other work in the same field because of bad referrals etc.|||I find this really weird. I live in the Netherlands and restaurants will always provide their own cars and scooters for delivery drivers. The idea that you have to buy your own equipment to do a job that creates profit for your employer but not directly for you (no additional reimbursement for the use of your own car) just seems madness to me.Most people here also don't tip delivery drivers anymore. You order online, pay online and the driver just drops of your order and leaves. Most people wouldn't have cash at home anyways most of the time (I know I don't). 'In the old days' you'd pay the driver for your food at the door, in that case you'd just round the costs up a bit and that would be a tip.This actually makes me understand why tipping is so important in the US.|||regular!|||If you want to give this a try: I *really* recommend just using those cheap notebooks you have lying around and just *do it*. Try it out for 4 weeks or so, and you'll really get a feeling if some things work or don't work for you.And yes, for me, it actually is quite a task to keep up with my bullet journal and keep everything properly organized, but the time spend on journal management vs. the efficiency gained by actually being able to remember everything I need to do and actually doing them by far outweighs the lost time in managing the journal. I know this is r/bulletjournal, but if you have the feeling you might actually actually find an electronic system more useful, use the electronic system, bullet journaling is not per definition better than any other system, it's about what works for you. There is a lot of apps/pc software available. For example, check out the app 'My Effectiveness'. I know a few people who really enjoy using it and get the same benefit from it as I do from my journal.|||Google 'Sphynx cat'. Sphynxes are super skinny cats... There is no way in hell you wouldn't notice this cat being obese as it's owner. That's like saying you didn't notice your dad hit the 600lb mark and you didn't realize your dad was unhealthy because of it.|||Isn't there something you can do already? I don't know what your field is/your interest are.. but surely you can think of something. For example, I'm currently busy with a project I call the 'Women in Science programme' which is a mentoring programme for female STEM graduate students who want to continue in research in which they are teamed up with young female academic staff (which are really rare to find!). I'm not interested in pursuing an academic career myself, but I am very passionate about the lack of female STEM representation in general so that's why I started this project. Something totally not *directly* related to my studies, but something that does provide really valuable skills and keeps my mind happy and occupied. Maybe you can find something similar, maybe get a team together and build a big ass robot or something. There are many competitions and maybe you'd even get your uni to pay for the costs if you want to enter the competition under the uni's names. Or start a home lab. Build a kick ass portable music set from raspberry pi's. Build several websites. Really, there are *so* many options which all teach you valuable skills.|||At that age I was very focussed on my role models, people I respected. This could be peers I respected but mostly grown ups. I looked to them to learn how to be the person and leader I wanted to be.Maybe, if you know who he respects, you could ask those people to discuss this topic with him?|||I don't agree with points 2 and 3, especially with regard to STEM degrees. Even before international bachelor programmes became a 'thing' a very big part of the 'Dutch' degrees where done in English, simply because courses are given by academic staff which are more often than not international themselves. Also the same with language proficiency: you'll be just fine in the Netherlands/Germany/Scandinavia just knowing English as the whole population speaks English reasonably as well. Also with regards to employment: if it were anything other then STEM I'd agree, but there certainly is a market for international engineering students, because there are shortages. The chances of getting a job in Europe while having graduated at a US uni are slim, but if you are studying in thw country itself and take networking seriously during your studies, you'll find a job that will provide you with a visa. Many western EU countries also have 'graduate visas' which allow you to stay an x amount of time after you completed your studies, specifically to find a job.|||Thanks :)|||23F, Dutch. Living situation: living with SO in a rental. Both of us still students.Income: wherever I can find in terms of student assistantships and some grants.

If you want to check whether you can get citizenship, check this first, I guess, as you might not qualify due to these age restrictions. For my heritage claim, it in the end didn't matter, but I was on a ticking clock until then. Considering it took me almost 1.5 years before I formally applied, yeah.. it might not be feasible in your case any way.|||Is the a lot of difference between ASL and BSL and the other regional variants? I'd like to learn sign language, but I live in the Netherlands so the only resources I'm able to find are Dutch Sign Language based.. but I won't be living here anymore in maybe 5 years as I want to travel the world and become the life long expat. If there is a lot of difference between the languages, it seems rather pointless to invest the time and energy in Dutch Sign Language.|||General comment: In case of the girlfriend (coming from a girl that's in a LTR), just tell her to hold her thought for a moment because your quite occupied at the moment. After the fight, put your controller down, walk to her, sit down with her, look at her while she is talking and just be overall present. Girls dig that. Girls dig this a lot more than a 'sure bae' while you're jamming a controller and didn't even hear what she was saying in the first place.|||Farts are funny. Me and my SO definitely make jokes like these among each other. Jokes like, one is looking the other dead in the eye and says 'I need to fart'. Stands up, and starts walking towards the other making the other run away in an attempt to not get farted on (usually unsuccessfully).Anyway, really, you should just tell her. I mean.. It's a fart. I assume you have sex and have probably shared a lot more other icky and sticky bodily smells and fluids between each other. A fart is nothing. Just tell her.|||You're not looking for doctors who are willing go sterilize 20 somethings though, that's mostly what the sidebar is for. You are simply looking for a doctor to give BASIC anticonception prescriptions. In that case you only need to find a clinic that's not batshit fundamentlist christian crazy.|||It's not being an ambivert. I am not the same as this person you replied to, but extraversion vs introversion really has to do with energy management. Extraverts get a lot of *additional* energy from socializing, while introverts (yay, like me) are drained from social interactions. Ambiverts are more or less neutral on that scale, they don't expend energy socializing, nor do they really gain any. (It's a spectrum, really.) It's definitely possible to be really outgoing and love to socialize, while also being extremely introverted (yay, again, like me). I for example love going to bars and meeting with friends and going to concerts and all the other things that are high intensity on the socializing scale. I just have a *really* limited amount of energy that I can spend on it, and although I hate it, I need several hours a day having some serious alone time, not being bothered by anyone.|||Ok listen. I'm about your age and my SO is also going through depression with suicidal feelings. First up: don't move in with him because of the depression, but only if you want to actually live with him despite the depression. I'm saying this because you need to take care of you first, before you can help him. My SO describes his depression as if a demon that's hanging over him constantly and causing awful little voice in the back of his head is whispering to him how useless and awful he is as a person, how he's worthless and should just end it. I think this description is important because it shows that somebody with depression doesn't actively choose to think and feel what they do, but that it's simply there, despite them fighting against it. Sometimes, when he's tired or stressed that voice in the back of his head gets too loud and he can't shush it anymore. That's when he starts having panic attacks and suicidal thoughts. My SO has learned to come to me and talk to me as soon as that happens. I help him through this by acknowledging his pain and slowly talking and hugging him through an episode. He explains it as me being the voice of reason that pushes the little voice back to the back of his mind, when he doesn't have the strength to do so himself anymore.So that's my advice: you need to open up the communication lines with your SO. Talk about eachothers feelings, fears and triumphs on a daily basis. Both of you, not just him! Build some trust and let him feel and know he can come to you for anything, *must* come to you for anything that's wrong. You don't need to start about the comment, I'm guessing you know damn well he's not well even before you saw that piece of text.We live together, we have a daily ritual when we go sit outside and drink some tea and talk through the day and whatever we felt that day before going to bed. This can be about anything: his depression, fun moments with friends, our relationship, our parents.. any feelings we experienced that day, good or bad. I would recommend finding a similar ritual to talk about the feelings in your relationship.Also, support him when he goes to see his psychs. Maybe go with him if he prefers? Maybe see if you can be home at his place when he comes home from an appointment? Talk to him about this. My SO often said the most important thing I do is simply *being there for him*. And remember: before you can take care of him, you need to take care of you. You can work through this with your SO, big chance those comments he made were made during an awfully dark episode and he isn't actively planning to off himself. But if you are to help him, you need to be in a good place to begin with. Get your own support system up and running and made sure you stay healthy by enjoying things. Eat well, exercise, go out with your friends, etc. And I know it's scary. I often feel scared as well.. very scared actually. But depression can be overcome, really. Stay strong and stay hopeful and fight through this, *together* as partners in life.|||Beetje rond zitten kijken en lezen. Ik denk dat je een sterk argument maakt voor 100% aandelen.Ik vroeg me af waarom je voor Vanguard VT kiest als voorbeeld. Als ik het goed begrijpt volgt VT de FTSE Global All Cap index. Ik lees ook vaak het advies om voor S&amp;P500 te gaan. Ik vind het lastig te vergelijken en tussen indexes een beoordeling te maken. S&amp;P500 lijkt wat beter te performen t.o.v. FTSE Global All Cap, maar FTSE had qua start datum een beetje nare timing vanwege de 2008 crash waardoor de data niet strak naast elkaar te leggen is. Ander punt waar ik voornamelijk mee zit in deze vergelijking, is dat Vanguard een S&amp;P 500 ETF variant heeft die op de Euronext verhandeld wordt in Euros, terwijl de FTSE ETF geloof ik uitsluitend in Dollars wordt verhandeld. Heb je dan niet gedoe met wisselkoersen?Goede tip over DeGiro, ik zie dat praktisch alle Vanguard ETFs zijn opgenomen in hun zogenaamde 'kernselectie' waarvoor ze geen transactie kosten vragen.|||This is so weird.

Most of my engineering classes allow a standard data companion book, which as all info standard integrals, general other math stuff and all relevant chemical engineering mathematical functions and relations. It's not about memorization, it's about knowing how to solve problems using basic knowledge everyone could look up.Hell, there are multiple classes where the professor tells us: \\\"you can bring anything you want, even worked out old exams, whatever, I don't care, it won't help you anyway if you don't know the material to a T.\\\" Those exams are the worst, but also the most satisfying to pass.|||Your best shot will probably be to enter the country on a student visa and do your masters in Germany. It's actually quite affordable compared to the US. This also gives you time to search for work in your field. Like /u/nicolekay said below, only a bachelors degree will not really get you anywhere. I'm not sure about Germany, however, in the Netherlands we have regulations for non EU students that they can get an extra year on their visa after completing their studies to look for a job in the Netherlands without too much of a hassle. I'm guessing Germany will have something similar.|||Dutch, same here.

Interesting though, thanks for letting me know.|||Something I don't necessarily hate but simply dislike when dealing with Americans in their fake, insincere 'happy to see you' attitude. Me: 'hi.'American: 'Oh hey! I haven't seen you in aaaaages. How are you? We should totally hang out sometime!'... Just fuck off. You don't care about me, I don't care about you and we both know it. And you know what? That's just fine. Let's not pretend otherwise for fucks sake.|||I don't think the comparison with the Netherlands is a fair one though, as the government determines maximum costs for all procedures. I'm not sure about implants (no experience with them) but for example, a normal check up by law this year can't cost more than 20 euros. A simply xray is 15 euros, a full jaw xray about 65 euros, simple cavity filling is 22 euros, simple wisdom tooth removal 40 euros.. etc etc.. These are prices you won't find in the US and are cheap enough to allow proper dental care even for people on a budget without dental insurance.|||Same story for me. I'm Dutch and I expect my loans to be around the 60-70k after graduation. The thing is, the interest on these gov loans are *below* inflation (this year's interest is 0.01%). For sure I'm going to stretch paying it off for the full 35 years the government is giving me for it.|||Showing your brother (or your mother, or your sister, or your best friend) the result of your surgery however is not. Again, breasts are not inherently sexual, just like ankles (although they were considered just as sexualized as breast some time in the Victorian past). If your girlfriend shows you the scars on her breasts from surgery, you don't get an immediate raging boner and want to throw her in bed right that second either.|||Now I understand why my teacher uses both. We have neither of those sounds in our native language and some students don't hear the difference between the Mandarin r and our own native r. So usually she uses the English sounding r sound to pronounce words and if the students don't get is she makes it more like a leisure z sound which are easier to differentiate from our native r.|||Can you tell me about a couple of brands you like?|||Yup, and the thing is, the amount you 'save' on your monthly payments are small compared to the higher risk. You would need multiple years of not needed any specialized healthcare to just break even on the costs you might save.

(and continue talking shit about you behind your back to other people)|||Does your boyfriend even *want* to work in his field anymore? Would it make him happy if he would?I'm asking because my and my boyfriends situation is very similar. I'm highly ambitious and over the past couple of years, we came to the conclusion my boyfriend simply wouldn't be happy with a similar career.My dreams for the future now are that my career will have priority and my SO will support me in my career. I hope he'll find a part time job that gives him joy (even if it's bartending or whatever) and that he'll have time to read his books, work out and cook.We approach this with an 'us against the world' mentality and this is probably what would make *us* the happiest, not necessarily only me or him.|||I use noise and music for a couple of things: 1. I am highly introverted, which is mainly experienced through high sound sensitivity. When I have music on the background I can just zone out from people and noises in general and keep me from getting my energy drained. Background music is constant and if chosen correctly predictable in types of sounds so it feels familiar and safe and doesn't cost energy.2. Background noise stops me from constantly thinking about.. well.. everything. It's a subconscious focus point, without it, my mind is just all over the place and gives me head aches. 3. When I need to do something that requires focus, such as studying, I put on music with a certain beat that for some reason seems to resonate with my concentration. It helps.|||This post made me realize people put more time and consideration in buying a house than they do on deciding to have children. That makes me sad. :(|||I kinda disagree with you to be honest. I don't think negatively towards the line and not being the indented target group are correlated.For example, I have a very specific HYPER feminine style of dressing which mixes 50s style with a modern twist. But I can look at albums of women on this sub who have a style that ranges from sporty, to Southern US cowgirl, to totally androgynous. These are totally different shapes and styles and of course I feel like that I would never buy into those styles myself, but I still look at those albums and think: damn, that's a gorgeous style that fits that person well.The same goes for men. I have seen pictures of men wearing incredible female styled clothes, which also looked gorgeous on them. I even remember a post from not to long ago on this sub from a guy who wanted to dress more feminine and the album he provided was in my opinion really suitable for unisex styling without giving up on fit and style.Now, when I look at the pictures of the HM clothing line in the article, I don't get any of those feelings. I don't like it one bit. And that's not because I wouldn't wear it personally (I wouldn't though) it really because I simply don't like it at all. Look, fit, shape, the whole deal, I simply don't like it. I have definitely seen better unisex outfits in my opinion. But if others like it, that's totally OK as well.. but that doesn't make the opinion of those who don't like it for whatever reason invalid.|||For your first question, it's really important to understand that the Dutch law makes a very strong distinction between *selection* and *admission*. Only a very select few degree programmes are allowed to *select* students, mostly med degrees and some others. In all other cases, the university sets admission criteria. To understand admission, you need to understand Dutch secondary education. Dutch high school has different 'levels'. After primary school, you need to take some kind of IQ test which will place you in a specific high school level. Only the highest level gives you access to university education. And that's the trick, in the Netherlands, if you have the right high school education, by law, the university must accept you into their programmes, unless it's one of those specific selecting degrees. So, when a university sets admission criteria for foreign diploma's, it will only try to somewhat match the highest level of dutch high school and admit anyone who fits those criteria. This is very different compared to many other universities, who do select their foreign applications. Which, in my oppinion makes it even more impressive that the RUG is top 100 world wide. Anyway, you should realize that this in no way means that the degree programme is easy. At the RUG, you need to get 75% of your first year credits. If you don't, you'll be kicked off the programme, and won't be allowed to re-enroll in that *or a similar programme (such as physics)* for about 3 years after getting kicked off. At the Faculty of Science and Engineering (which included the Mathematics degree), on average, *1/3* of all first year students will not be allowed to continue their studies. By the way, the EU has an overarching system that matches degrees from any EU country to another (google 'Bologna Process' if you want to know more). This also means that if you get your BSc at Groningen, this will qualify as an entry diploma for any other MSc Mathematics programme in Europe.If you wan't to stay in the Netherlands, or mainland Europe in general, even for mathematics it's highly suggested to get your masters. A bachelor diploma is not *really* considered a starting qualification over here.|||In the Netherlands you can still get dental insurance (on top of your medical insurance). But in most cases, it's useless because it's cheaper to pay out of pocket. For example, I just checked the rates on my own insurance company: - 12 euros a month for 250 euros coverage a year.- 20 euros a month for 500 euros coverage a year.- 35 euros a months for 750 euros coverage a year. My most expensive year was when I needed 2 check ups, 2 wisdom teeth removals, a filling, 2 small x-rays and a full jaw x-ray. Those costs added up to 300 euros or something. If I would have had insurance, I would have paid the following for either the cheapest or mid range option:- 12 months * 12 euros = 144 euros, and another 50 euros not covered. Totals to about 200 euros.- 12 months * 20 euros = 240 euros. So for this year, I would have saved about 100 euros... but the thing is, I already saved those 100 euros by not paying for insurance the year before and just paying my 2 check ups out of pocket! So no.. for most people, dental insurance is useless for people in the Netherlands.|||Do you have any hackerspaces or makerspaces nearby?

After they call article 50, the EU laws give them 2 years to make new treaties and such and during those 2 years the EU treaties will still be in place to allow for a transition period. The UK then either can say at one point during those 2 years 'hey, we arranged everything, were done, recall the EU treaties please!' and if they don't all EU treaties between the EU and the UK will simply cease to exist after that 2 year mark, whether the UK is ready or not.That's why Cameron resigned and refused to trigger article 50 on his watch right after the referendum. He's trying to buy time for his country by giving the UK an excuse why they *can't* trigger article 50 right now (political chaos which needs to be resolved first).|||Thanks for this idea!

I'm Dutch and I have multiple family members who got into US colleges based on their Dutch diplomas, no SAT required. Also, in the Netherlands EU citizens pay 1900 euros a year for university tuition, non EU students pay 11-13k. I call that a big difference. It's similar in most countries, with the exception of Germany for both EU and non EU (very low tuition, no difference between groups) and scandinavia where some scandinavian countries have free higher education for EU people. The UK is ridiculously expensive, for both EU and non EU students, compared to the mainland, with EU fees at 9k pounds and non EU fees at 13-15k pounds.Edit: not to mention issues with language requirements. Although many Masters degrees are taught in English, bachelors usually are not, except for ofcourse programmes in the UK and quite a few in the Netherlands. There's actually a massive influx of UK students in Dutch unis because of the lower fees in the Netherlands. If you want to study in another country, you'll meed proof of language proficiency, usually at b2 or c1 level, which is quite high.|||I actually agree with u/redearth to be honest.I am an TYPE_MENTION on a management track and have worked with a lot of high level executives.Having your outside life managed is in no way a reason to think the inside is. My schedules and way of working are tight and strict, but my mind - like u/redearth described - is a mess in the sense that is it constantly taking in new info, rearranging thoughts, seeking new connections, coming up with things I should have done but haven't yet and reconsidering relevance/efficiency etc, etc. This J-attitude is quite common among the executives I've worked with and it's what makes them innovative and good executives who can channel their foresight into action. My TYPE_MENTION partner on the other hand thinks EVERY FUCKING THING he comes across is interesting and devours any book on any topic he comes across and can randomly decide to be interested in something all different at once. He's the kind that can stop in the middle of the street because he saw an unfamiliar flower and wanted to know what kind it was, only to end up discussing the recently new found system of planets an hour later because somehow his mind linked the two together. However, when he discusses how he processes information and how he stores new info, he has a very efficient web like structure in his mind to which he adds info and makes connections. For him to think of what info he still is missing is a hyper analytical and guided process. Having a 'disciplined' outer life is the only way for me to structure my messed up, almost ADHD like inner life. My partner seems ADHD like from the outside, but his mind is in fact very focussed.|||For me parental love is defined as the love between parent and child, so no, per definition, that's not a factor between my SO and I. And sexual drive is also not necessarily a factor, for I would feel the same kind of the love even if I were asexual but without the sexual urges.|||Not american but I read enough of /personalfinance to know US private study loans are an absolute hell hole. I also can't imagine your masters degree to be that specific that it's only thought at the uni you have in mind. Any chance there are other unis that do qualify for federal loans that offer a similar degree?|||Thank you so much for your reply. I had a look at your post and you are right, were really are in the same boat. I also saw you posted in /r/depression .. (and also shout out to /u/amsterdam_BTS ) I had a look at other depression related subreddits a month or so ago as well and I was incredibly frustrated about the lack of support groups and the like for partners/family of depressed people, either here on online in general. We have to be strong all the damn time.. to our partners, to our family and even if you have good friends outside of your social circle with your SO, chances are they simply don't understand what it means to live with a depressed SO and tell you the same stupid shit they'd tell depressed people (eg. 'you should just try to be happy'). In the end.. it's just *lonely*. Having more people around you who understand what you're going through would help a lot.|||USA know jus soli, being born in the USA entitles you to US nationality. Italy knows jus sanguinis, meaning nationality is passed through blood. Question here is: did your great grandfather ever get naturalized? If so, before or after your grandfather was born? In the case of your grandfather being born before your great grandfather got naturalized your grandfather has the right to Italian citizenship, if your great grandfather got naturalized before your grandfather was born he effectively renounced his Italian citizenship and your grandfather only has the right to US citizenship (implying all offspring from your grandfather also does not have the right to Italian citizenship). If your great grandfather never got naturalized, of course your grandfather still held the rights to Italian citizenship. You say your *grand*father got naturalized in 1944, this confuses me as he should get US citizenship at the very least based on jus soli as your great grandfather was living in the US and thus wouldn't need to be naturalized. But if his naturalization is indeed the case, same questions for your grandfather in relationship to your father, you say he was naturalized in 1944. When was your father born? Before of after naturalization of your grandfather? In the case you indeed have the right to Italian citizenship, be prepared to fetch original birth certificates *and* proof of citizenship certificates of all four generations (yourself, father, grandfather, great grandfather). Especially in case of your great grandfather these documents will probably only be available at his birthplace in Italy. You may also even need the death and marriage certificates, not sure if this is the case in Italy, but some countries do require these as well.|||Without 50 hours beforehand you'd probably be at an A1 level, so yeah, just the basics. What do you see as 'reasonable conversational level'? Your flair says you're at Mandarin B1, that to me would be reasonable conversational level.. and to me, it would be doable, but only if you'd spend those 6 weeks on very active language immersion with probably some language classes.|||Hahahaha. Hell no. Thank God. You know all those international editions with big stickers that say 'not for sale in the US' which are also a fraction of the price compared to the US editions? They are also rewritten in metric units from cover to cover so we don't have to deal with that crap. (European student)|||The thing is, kids are a non negotiable. Yes, it would be unfair of you two would be in a long term relationship and you suddenly decided on your own to get a job abroad, because these are decision that need to be made as a family unit and can be compromised on. However, you can't conpromise on having kids and there won't be a family unit to start with if non negotiables don't align.That being said, I've also had this discussion with my boyfriend. Although we both are childfree, I'd prefer non of us take permanent action. If my SO truly wanted it, there is not a lot I can do of course, but not using permanent methods is preferred. I told my husband: I'm sure I don't want kids, I'm sure you don't want either, but we simply can't know for sure how either of us feels in 20 years, so why do anything permanent if it isn't necessary because I'm perfectly fine with using the pill and abortion is free of charge in our country? Then again, it's a lot easier for me to say this as I'm the woman in this case who has full bodily autonomy and control.|||LC too, and this is how I approach it: do not offer solutions. Pick up the phone, make confirmative sounds every 20 seconds and just continue redditing or whatever. After 10-15 min max, you say 'oh sorry mum, but I need to go do *whatever comes to mind*' and you end the conversation. Also: only pick up the phone when you're up to it and if she asks why you didn't pick up you were busy doing *whatever comes to mind*. Ns are only interested in themselves, so they won't care about the reason really.|||I wanted to let you know I got my ears pierced last Wednesday. I really appreciate your help in educating me on what to look for! I got some basic white opal, titanium labrets.They are healing up perfectly. No irritation, redness or swelling whatsoever, just a lot of itching which is typical healing wounds. I'm having great difficulty to keep my hands of them though. It feels so nice to just feel them and wiggle them around a bit. I know I shouldn't. Thanks for everything.|||The article says this is due to baby boomers getting older and 55+ baby boomers simply work less, both males and females. This 'sudden increase' is not due to single moms leeching on men like OP mentions somewhere in the comments according to the article.Dear OP, I as a woman consider myself a feminist and because I believe in feminism I am a very active supportive of men's rights as supporting men's rights are an integral part of support feminism: equal rights for *both* sexes. However, comments like those here makes it difficult to feel connected with this Reddit men's right community if there is so much hostility towards women in general. You believe 'we' are the problem, yet are not very welcoming to 'us' solving the problem 'we' apparently are causing and getting better at recognizing male discrimination.EDIT: I'm getting a lot of comments on the feminist political movement (aka feminazi movement) and that feminism is just that. I disagree that all of feminism can be put in the same sentence as the feminazi movement, for the *meaning* of feminism is equal rights for both sexes, even if a group of feminazi's like to think otherwise. There is a reason why I am not subscribed to for example TwoX and the like. If feminism in general makes you so angry: fine, I'll not call myself a feminist but equalist in stead as it covers the same ground.|||As it's my top level comment you are replying to, I just want to let you know how important your attitude will be to your little girl. My dad was my absolute hero, who fought for me and my non gender typical interests. He is, beyond any doubt, the sole reason why I'm now studying to become an engineer, because he supported me along every step of the way when others would only doubt me, my interest and capabilities. Even if your daughter ends up as a nurse (without a doubt a very noble profession!) and wants nothing to do with STEM, you are teaching her some valuable lessons, of which arguably the most important one is about what kind of qualities she should look for in her future husband and - if she wants kids - the future father of her daughters and sons.|||Just a heads up, the Netherlands actually doesn't allow dual citizenship throug naturalization, unless you can't legally give up your former nationality (say, Maroccan for example). In most cases, if you can give up your nationality, they mandate you if you want the Dutch nationality. (Of course this is not the case with jus sanguinis)|||In that case, I think HSK 2 is a good indication. The gap from HSK 2 to 3 is a big one but should also be possible if you *really* work at it. Know that HSK 2 is still all in pin yin, but HSK 3 is characters only. This is usually the biggest struggle for foreign language learners trying their hand at Mandarin. If you want to get more out of your course, consider keeping up with learning characters from the very, very start.|||What about his claim to his Moroccan nationality/citizenship? Many countries have rules about losing your citizenship if you voluntarily go into military service of a foreign state. Would be good to check this.|||No, this does not matter at all. The non-EEA family visa is uniform across the whole Schengen zone. But I would advice *not* entering through the Netherlands as your husband is a Dutch citizen and the Dutch customs might make it more trouble than need be, because like the top comment said, the rules to settle in NL with your spouse if you are a NL citizen are different.|||Focus on either leveling or exploring. Once you're in explore mode, simply don't give a shit about the echos and if you don't give a shit about echos, you also don't have to give a shit about dying! Explore, die, maybe try the same route again, or try a branch somewhere along the path.Also, some disagree on this with me, but I think especially for new players there is really no shame in using the wikis, its maps and its walkthroughs. The point of the game is to explore it, if reading up on it helps you enjoy it more, who cares. It will also make you more confortable with the game itself when you have more experience under your belt and with so many places to explore, you can always just decide to stop using wikis at any point in the game.|||Thanks, I'll look into it!|||I don't know why you are downvoted, for me, a woman who really likes games like BB en DaS and many many others, this topics is really bothering me and I think you are spot on. Take for example (aweful game, but good example) AC: Syndicate. The developers even said they prided themselves in their attempts to show equality. However.. to me it is simply ridiculous that 50% of all soldiers in industrial revolution London are women in the game. Thank you for not sexualizing them, absolutely, thank you for making female characters which are more than 'sex sells' objects, but really.. this makes NO fucking sense and is done only to make a point and show the world that the development team cared about gender equality. It takes away from the story.|||Get your ass into a US grad school asap! You said you'd be afraid about the dept... Last time I checked DUO will loan you the money for tuition, also when you'll be studying abroad and as such will match the tuition fees of your foreign university and not only offer the Dutch 2k a year. If this is still the case (check this!) you'll be under the same rules to pay it off as 'Dutch taught students'. Currently that's at an interest rate of 0.4%, which is lower than inflation (!), start paying it back only after two years of graduating and only a max of 4 percent over your income above minimum Dutch income for 35 years. Any debt left will be paid by the state. That means: if you don't get a job anyway, you won't be paying back a dime. Quick edit: Also... I'm not sure about this one, call DUO about it to be sure, but I believe DUO only will loan you the money for your *first* degree, so don't make the mistake to first get your Dutch masters degree as you'll likely loose out on the cheap social loan to do a second degree in the US.|||What.. the.. fuck.. your mum really is something. I'd screenshot your messages with your mum and send them to your sis so both of you know who's the crazy shared denominator among you.|||Not sure, but you should Google 'IND'/'Integratie en Naturalisatie Dienst', which is the Dutch immigration department of the government and contact them about your question to get a definitive answer!|||Are you guys students or do either of you have a job? This matters, because if you want to get out of those subscription sites you'll need to go through agencies which only rent to people with jobs who can provide proof of income. Those usually explicitly exclude students. The shitty reality is that it's simply really difficult to get an apartment as a student couple.|||Oh yes, everyone does. They get their own set of safety glasses and when they leave lab during practicals for lunch or whatever they take them with them and students will only take off their glasses once they are on the hallways and before entering a lab. You don't put a single toe inside our labs without glasses if even one chemical is sitting around.But then again, this is also something that is strictly enforced during their first lab course with 'kind reminders' and you *do* get yelled at if you forget during any subsequent courses. Our research labs do have issues with this though with all kinds of foreign researches. Every research groups needs a safety officer and we have an unwritten rule only Dutch researchers can hold that positiom becausr of this.|||Even within academia, I'm having the feeling womens studies is much less a 'thing' in Europe compared to the US. I know maybe one degree programme in my whole country that can be compared to womens studies, but by far it isn't as wide spread as in the US. Finding a PhD or tenure track in this area in Europe might be very difficult because of this.|||Like I said, everybody bikes here. I've honestly never met anyone who would carry an extra set of (flat) shoes to bike with. Maybe with the exception if someone would want to wear some amazing expensive shoes to an event and it's raining outside. (Like I said, everybody uses their bike, alwaya, even when it's raining.)The thing is, biking with heels is super easy, because if your bike is sized properly to your length, even on flat shoes, nothing but your toes and the ball of your foot would be touching the pedels or the ground anyway. So essentially, even when biking with flat shoes you're holding your feet in heeled shoe position.|||Any chance you have Irish/Scottish heritance? Or maybe your wife has European roots (some EU countries have very easy jus sanguinis laws).There are more arguments to just move and go, because the 5 years start from the moment you hold a valid permit, which in your case would be the moment you find a home and claim the Netherlands your home at the local municipality. The UK has a maximum of 2 years to get everything in order *after* they trigger article 50... and I reckon the UK government will take it's time to actually trigger article 50. At that point, you are already half way into permanent residency and I figure there might very well be some kind of regulations that will allow you to stay here one way or another..|||Edit: I reread and saw it is buy one get the second at 50% off. Not a true buy one get one (for free). That of course does change the calculation!I'm curious, how do you interpret it? It is totally normal for BOGO to mean that the most expensive item is charged, the cheapest is free. I'm not arguing against that. OP said he/she checked the sign and that the sign said scrapbooks and albums were part of the BOGO discount, but refills weren't mentioned. So I guess the refills were (wrongly) put in the system as BOGO items, which picked the most expensive item to be paid (refill), and cheapest to be discounted in full (scrapbook). In my country, discounts like BOGO do not stack whatsoever with additional coupons and any coupon discount would be applied to items not affected by the BOGO.. which is only the leftover second scrapbook. That's my train of thought in calculating the numbers.|||Nope, this used to be the case, but marriage now usually only leads to a 'verblijfsvergunning' based on which you can get naturalized to get a Dutch passport, and when you want a Dutch passport, you need to give up your current one is possible. Been through this.. 25 years ago my mother could indeed get a double nationality, but my current stepmother who got here 5 years ago can't anymore.|||Thank you for commenting, I replied in more general terms to the other poster.. but I wanted to respond specifically to your situation as well. I assume you guys live together?Please make sure you get enough 'me time'.. I make it a point of kicking my SO out of the house at least for 1 evening a week. He can go to friends or his parents, I don't give a shit, but he needs to GTFO so I can have the house to myself and have me time. I also make sure to go out myself often enough, either to visit friends or just go for a bike ride.. but, your home is your safe space. Everyone needs time alone in their safe space.This has helped me cope really, really a lot. I talked to his mum and she said something along the lines of \\\"He needs you to take care of him through this, and we all need to take care of you if you want to be able to care of him. That's why your health and well being has an even higher priority because when you're OK, he'll be OK\\\". That really opened my eyes and made me able to claim some more space, like telling him he should go visit friends so I can have time alone when I need it.|||I'd like to add some info on the differences between the US and EU higher education systems, as there are some key differences:In the EU practically nobody leaves university with only a bachelor degree, as practically all employers want to see a masters degree. A masters degree in engineering is usually a 2 year programme, with both courses and research. If you want to do a PhD, you need a masters degree first, there are very little combined programmes. Also, PhD programmes usually last 4 years and is almost always research only. In many mainland countries you are more like an employee (with salary!) and not a student. This means most PhD students also don't follow any courses/take exams during their PhD.Doing a masters in Europe is a highly specialized degree. Unlike colleges in the US, students in Europe choose a degree from the very start (no general education). You study chemical engineering or mechanical engineering from day one. For your master degree you'll often see even further specializations, such process engineering or chemical product engineering. Bachelor and masters degrees are very much linked. For example process/product engineering would be masters linked to the chemical engineering bachelor. You'll need the right bachelor to enter the master. Except for more general/multidisciplinary masters (Environmental sciences for example) it is usually not possible to switch to for example chemical product engineering from a mechanical engineering bachelor.  If you want to come to Europe as a US student, consider dropping the term 'grad school' when talking about it, because the differences between what is implied between grad school in the US and even between European countries are really big. Consider talking in terms in terms like 'getting a masters degree' or 'getting a PhD' instead.|||Nope, UK is **not** part of the Schengen zone!|||I have a two year old brother, I'm 23 now. This has been my own main worry *for him* ever since I was told about the pregnancy. My dad was early 50s and my step mum was mid 40s. Based on average life expectancy for my father's year of birth my little brother will have to bury him before he's 30 years old, while I will most likely have had my father in my life for most major milestones and the majority of my life. In many ways, I still feel they have been incredibly selfish by wanting a child at their age.I'm experiencing the same fears of loss just imaging having the deal with illness and parental death at this stage of my life, just thinking about what my brother will go through. I can't imagine actually living through the reality of it.|||Go to Turkey, once there you have bought yourself time to figure out in detail what the visa and citizenship procedures are for a bunch of countries to decide on your next move. Lots of European countries also recognize the Turkish diploma's so a masters degree in Europe is also an option.|||See if your uni/school has exchange partners in Europe and get 6-12 months worth of credits abroad. Even if they don't have exchange partners, you might be able to arrange something like this all by yourself, but it will be much more of a hassle.Usually, you don't have to pay extra tuition fees if you go on exchange, but do note you won't be allowed to work on a student visa, so you'll need the funds to support yourself while you are here, Because you'll still be enrolled at your home uni, it might be possible to retain US federal funding and such, even when coming over to the EU for an exchange.|||Average master student ages are 21 to 24, PhD students at mid to end 20 for our STEM students. The genetal age bracket of 30 to 40 for staff isn't a strong cut off point, however, it puts staff about 10 to 15 years ahead in their career compared to mentees. This will make it easier for mentees to relate compared to senior staff. Also, the gender landscape now is different to 20 years ago. My personal mentor is now in her 50s, but her experiences when she was my age are very much different from the experiences of younger staff.|||I identified myself as an TYPE_MENTION in my teens before realizing I'm actually an TYPE_MENTION. My main issue with the I vs E descriptors was how they described 'getting energetic' from either external or internal sources. As a teen, the only thing I knew was how impossibly exhausting it was to be in highly social situations and how it *drained* my energy to the core. It was only after moving out and living on my own, actively choosing my own social circles that I figured out I actually do get highly energized from other people, but only when I feel the interactions are actually meaningful and the discussions are about.. you know.. actually discussing stuff. I get energized by people if those people actually tickle my intuitive side. It's like.. my COGFUNC_MENTION is always on and running, but when social interactions jump starts my COGFUNC_MENTION.. that feeling of every gear running and turning and things coming together is amazing. Turned out that the social context I was exposed to as a child/teen was highly COGFUNC_MENTION driven, something I could not (still not) deal with at all. My mother is an TYPE_MENTION, and with her came a bunch of feeler(/sensor) friends who always tried to 'include' me in their social engagements. Lots of immediate family that exposed strong F(e) tendencies as well. This was how I grew up to understand what the norm was of 'being social' and my conclusion was that I hated it because it drained me mentally to the point of exhaustion, so I must have been an introvert. I had very little exposure to intuitive people in general now that I think about it, beside my father who's an TYPE_MENTION but who is a rather reclusive person.|||Use your female name and Turkish surname. Many Dutch people have a 'roepnaam' (a 'calling' name) and a legal name. At one point, the company might need your legal credentials for tax purposes etc, but at that point you can just matter of factly state that you are a MtF transgender person but still have your old male as legal first name. If they have a problem with it at that point (most companies wouldn't)  you really don't want to be working for them in your position to begin with.Using an English surname while you have a legal Turkish surname would be really weird and I think many companies would somehow perceive it as deceitful.|||I started out with Chemical Engineering and took on a double major at the end of my first year and added Industrial Engineering. I still have the same philosophy about having a job now at university... my government provides *very* low interest loans (currently 0.01%) for students so I'm investing a lot of money into getting my degrees and doing a lot of extra curriculars.. sometimes I earn some money by being a TA, but I only ever do things I find beneficial for my future and provide me a real edge, instead of working at the local bar or grocery store... Yes, I'll graduate with maybe 70k in (low interest) loans, but if that means I can ear 2-3x the average starting salary, all of that doesn't matter anymore. Anyway, I was raised in a very international family, we all have the travel bug.. I can't stay in one place too long, so I want my career to be all over the world.. living a max of 5 years in a single country/region. So I'm trying to learn a bunch of language that would benefit me. In high school I learned English, German, French and Latin (don't underestimate it, I am very proficient in Latin in, and because of it I can actually read a lot of Spanish and Italian as well) and I was raised bilingual in Dutch and Serbian. Next to the double degree I spend my remaining time on learning more languages, currently learning Mandarin.. I'm currently in the hospital, but the moment I'm out can get back to my regular life, I'll take up French again (could be a bit better still) for a year next to Mandarin.. after that year, I'll do Mandarin and either Spanish or Arabic. For me, as I want to live all over the world, the languages English, Mandarin, Arabic and Spanish are most important I guess... If I were you, I'd really pick up Spanish again.. in Europe we have a language proficiency system (European Reference Framework, look it up maybe) and in my opinion, languages are only truly useful once you hit the B2 level or higher, because at B2 you're considered to have a professional proficiency and will be able to study or work in that language. This is why when companies look for multilingual people, most employers will look for a B2 proficiency or higher.|||As an TYPE_MENTION in a long term relationship:Sure, but why would you *want to*? I mean, I might love a person emotionally, but realize that being with this person will take a lot of constant work and energy, just to be comfortable and communicate.. Or I could find somebody else with whom I communicate effortlessly, somebody it takes absolutely zero energy to be with because we're just a better fit. Yes, I might love the more difficult to be with person and it would be hard on me to pull away, but in the end, loving somebody is also a *choice* we make and when you make the choice to pull away, the emotional strain will fade.|||Another thing you should do is to check the Deutscher Qualifikationsrahmen to determine the level of your education. This is an agreed upon system across Europe, and if you know on which level your educational level is scaled to you can look online for the same chart of educational levels in the country/region you're going to. That way you know when you're applying for jobs which ask a diploma from education type X whether type X is equivalent to your German diploma.|||I don't think perfect gender reassignment surgery will be a hypothetical in the near future anymore to be honest, in the way that genitals post-op will be indistinguishable from birth genitalia.What if a XX woman is infertile? Or is simply sterilized out of her own wish?What if a woman had cervical cancer and needed a hysterectomy?What about infertile men? Snipped men?What about people with chromosome disorders? XXY/XYY/etc. They are not 'true' biological males and females.Should all these people disclose their medical background to a random sexual partner? Would that partner not be able to give informed consent if I didn't tell him I was sterile for whatever reason?I simply don't understand what the difference is with transgenders in your argument, opposed to a lot of other medical conditions which may affect societies view on what is a 'true' man or woman.|||If you have a very strong portfolio you'll be fine. Right now the best CompSci students are picked up during their degrees because demand can't be met, many CompSci students quit after their bachelors because they have jobs lined up, which is unusual in a country that really considers a masters degree the norm.|||Well there you go. That's the solution, now get at it.|||I'm learning Chinese (still a beginner!) in a western environment, and although I have a very supportive native Chinese teacher, submersion is difficult. I am really curious how good or outright awful EU/US non native speakers sound to Chinese native speakers. I mean, my teacher obviously understands me when I try to speak, but she's trained to understand, would a random Chinese person understand me as well?|||Diane Lockhart from The Good Wife. Love her. Too few kickass female TYPE_MENTION in series and movies.|||Or, you know, you could just search this sub and find this has been done a bunch of times, with nice graphics and everything to lay out all the results.|||I was thinking about pearls as well. My mentor is this lovely lady in her 50s and dresses super British, including pearls each day every day. She looks gorgeous for her age... but I'm not 50 yet! I think the single pearl is an excellent suggestion!|||TYPE_MENTION who sees a therapist. That's healthy self care I haven't seen anyone else answer here yet. Most of us could probably benefit from individual therapy to be honest.|||Just dropping by to tell you I read your story. Time will pass and you'll get older as it passes, I truly hope things will turn around for you and you'll find yourself  in a better spot soon enough.|||You'll be fine. For your passport: contact your nearest UK ambassy. Just give them a call and see what you need to send in. Probably you don't even have to show up yourself. However, these kind of applications can take months, so do this asap!Your academic background will help you in finding a job more easily, but considering you're moving to Europe, you might want to consider getting a masters degree as well, as having a master degree is still very much the norm except for very specific high in demand fields (programmers mostly). Once you'll have a EU passport you'll be able to attend universities for EU tuition fees, instead of international fees. Look into fields of study like Artificial Intelligence for example.|||Is she self conscious about her body and boobs in particular? In both cases, I think the only solution is to visit a good high quality shop. But if she is a bit insecure, it might be more difficult to convince her. Do your homework amd visit several shops yourself and talk to the staff. Make sure they are kind and knowledgable. If youe GF is a bit insecure, she might prefer a shop that's a bit smaller and less busy because it'll mean more privacy. Once you did your homework, you can take her to the shop you think is best so she doesn't have to worry about it.Be prepared though, good bras are really expensive.. I'm also 22 and a student and know the pain, but in the end, for women with larger breasts, poor quality bras aren't an option. Not only because of aesthetics but also because of general comfort and long term back problems bad bras may cause. Good bras go for about 60-100 euros.. this is something to prepare your GF for as well, as it is really uncomfortable to experience sticker shock when your doing something as intimate as trying on bras in strange surroundings.|||When I was school aged I was very torn between productivity and still enjoying my summer break. Especially because I had a burn out at 16 and had to stay home for almost 1.5 months to do nothing else but sleep because I wasn't in control of myself and my mind which lead to overburdening myself with *more* extracurriculars, *more* AP classes, *more* responsibilities. I learned the hard way what my boundaries are and how important holidays are for me.Anyway. I'd game like a madman (woman?) on my console. To me this was perfect. A competitive and achievement driven form of entertainment.|||I guess it is just as offensive for us to preach to childhappy people about their reproductive choices as it is offensive to us when people judge our choices though... Something about don't do unto others what you don't want others to do unto you.|||Think of it like this, you are supposed to feel uncomfortable and 'incompetent' while studying, because what is the point of only studying things that are within your comfort zone? An academic degree is meant to push you way out of that comfort zone, because that's the only way to become an expert. It's not easy and it's not supposed to be.If you forget everything after an exam, you're doing it wrong and are exactly doing the thing your teachers are warning you not to do: learning how to do exercises, instead of actually learning the material and skills to solve the exercises. Direct knowledge is useless, it's the problem solving skills and 'thinking like an engineer' that makes us such valuable assets to many, many sectors.|||It's not just affirmative action when it comes to scholarships though. Look at my country (the Netherlands) where everyone admitted to a university can get government funding, no scholarship system in place at all. And yet, we have the 60/40 ratio.|||Just curious, if you have a Dutch passport, why did you choose Germany, considering you could have studied practically everywhere in Europe at the reduced EU fees (except the UK)?Also curious, why didn't you study in the Netherlands? You probably could have gotten government stipends and/or government loans which are at 0% interest rate right now (usually at 0-0.5%).|||You are doing all the right things in realizing you're slipping and need help. My dearest (long term, 4 years) SO is going through the same process right now, so what I am about to say right now is mostly based on my experience with him.I think, as you already realize you are slipping, you should also realize you are not in the right mind to make decisions based on what you think is best for others. You keep saying 'maybe it is better for her if I break up with her', but frankly, even if you were mentally totally sound those are iffy statements to make, and right now, you are simply not able to make good decisions based on such thoughts.My advice to you is to ask yourself the following question: 'is this relationship beneficial to me and my family in the foreseeable future (next 6 months or so)?' If yes, do not break up with her. Communicate all your fears and thoughts with Nicki and let *her* decide for herself if indeed she is better off without you. Tell her you'd understand and accept that decision, but don't make that decision for her. It wouldn't be fair to either of you if you did.|||Yeah, I decided to set some rules for myself:No sugary drinks, either drink 0 calorie ones or better yet, replace by carbonated water.No peanut butter. I loooove peanut butter, but I realized I loved it a bit too much. I also threw out my jelly/jams and stuff.No buying lunch anymore, instead I pack my lunch: a salad with good, healthy stuff and no dressing, plus I pack an additional box with cucumbers, bell pepper, apple slices, etc to snack on throughout the day. No second servings at dinner. Fill your plate to a good and decent portion, and leave it at that. (Luckily my SO and I already have the habit of cooking our meals and eating little meat with lots of vegetables).Also, when I get hungry, I will first drink a big glass of water and wait for 30 minutes. If I'm still hungry, I'll eat something small. Some fruit or veggies. This is also a big deal, as I've always had trouble drinking enough water, making me overeat because of thirst instead of hunger.I also make it a point to not skip my breakfasts and eat a proper sandwich or two. I only way brown full grain bread, which has been a long term habit already which I'm happy with.Even with these basic rules I feel some competition going on in my mind though. When I feel hungry, it's easy for me to think, deal with it for a few hours and wait for dinner, less calories in means more calories used from fat, instead of simply getting myself an apple.|||I am an TYPE_MENTION woman, not a guy, but still, maybe my perspective will help you. Anyway, it's not that dating is 'business' or that TYPE_MENTION are bad with emotions. You don't give ages but usually, TYPE_MENTION do develop their emotional sides throughout their twenties, although emotions will always be rather.. I guess egocentric in the sense of some sort of existential crisis. Who am I? What do I want with my life? How do I deal with myself to reach those goals? Feelings for TYPE_MENTION are much less focused on others, more on themselves.Anyway, with TYPE_MENTION: everything needs to have a *vision* attached to *goals* and execution of those goals need to be ruthlessly *efficient*. So, sadly, don't expect TYPE_MENTION to be the hopeless romantic.. you'll need more of a feeling type for that. I mean, to an TYPE_MENTION it simply doesn't make sense because those emotions simply don't help them get ahead. *Unless* the partner verbalized what they need from their TYPE_MENTION, because then being romantic has a goal: to satisfy the partner and further the relationship. So, right now, you guys are still dating. I would start out with simply being assertive and asking your TYPE_MENTION out. 'Let's go see a movie together. How about this Saturday?' (note how I don't even ask if he wants to see a movie.. :P I just state that this is a decision that's so logical and natural it needn't be questioned). During your dates. Talk. Talk ideas, talk visions, talk the impossible all the other people don't see and don't care about. I think, in the dating stage, you need to set your romantic feelings aside for a bit, because frankly, at this stage for an TYPE_MENTION, it is more clinical than for other types. An TYPE_MENTION will objectively try to figure out if you are a compatible partner. How to know whether he's interested? He'll probably suggest seeing each other more often. If he's not interested, he'll simply tell you he's not interested. *Once you are in a relationship* you can simply be brutally honest with him. 'Sweety, I would prefer if you'd make the effort to text me goodnight when we don't sleep together, it would make me happy' or 'I would like to go out for dinner together, can you arrange something? I'd prefer a romantic atmosphere.' An TYPE_MENTION impossible drive for improvement means they really appreciate honest feedback, even negative feedback. Talk, vocalize what you feel and more importantly: vocalize what you want to see improved. Do expect the same treatment in return though.|||I currently have 2 inserts (and a zipper pouch), but 3 is very much doable as well, because the middle one will lie flat on the other two. I don't take them out, I just write in them like you'd expect.. No issues there whatsoever although, of course, the notebooks aren't perfectly flat like high quality notebooks usually are. So you'll have a little bit of budging in the middle of your notebooks. Anyway.. I think 6 notebooks are really excessive.. I don't think you'll be able to write comfortably in a 6 insert midori set up. It will probably also look like shit because they'll stick out tremendously.|||Dank voor je antwoord, ik ga ernaar kijken!|||I'm not too knowledgable on this specific subject, but some things that came into mind: how will US taxation work for your parents. I've heard a lot of horror stories about US expats. Also, most countries have renaturalization procedures in place for birthright citizenship holders who renounced citizenship. Also, some countries make it very difficult to have land/property as a foreigner. Maybe in your case it is more beneficial to reclaim Vietnamese citizenship and renounce the US one? This is something to discuss with a knowledgable accountant.|||This was exactly my realisation to become childfree. I figured I actually *would* want a kid, if the kid would fit my very specific wish list with regard to personality, health and intelligence. Then I realized that shit ain't reality, and I'd be very unhappy with that reality. My reasoning: I refuse to buy lottery tickets based on the rational reasoning that I won't win the money, the same way I won't win the genetic lottery when it comes to having children.|||No experience or knowledge with any of those universities. Just wanted to let you know as a young woman who's getting an engineering education you're clearly doing a kick ass job! As far as gender stereotypes go, girls are still gently pushed away from engineering in day to day life and it sucks :( ... Awesome dads like yourself give girls like me and your daughter the courage and confidence to do engineering! Thank you for raising an awesome daughter :)|||Yes, but. I'm guessing your US passport got stamped with an entry visa? You'll get issues with immigration if you don't get an exit stamp to match the entry within that 90 day period if a border control agent notices. There is a quick solution though. Treat yourself to a weekend in London, flights are super cheap and you'll be legally exiting Schengen. Exit France on your US passport and get your exit stamp, enter UK on Polish ID, return to France on Polish ID.|||Bullshit. When I started, I was top 10% of my class. Got bored when it wasn't challenging enough, wasn't motivated or discipled enough to put in enough work and I dropped to top 50%, barely above average. I figured, if I don't want to work, I need to force myself to work or face dropping out. Enter degree 2 but then I got bored again, enter degree 3. Now I'm having a work load that keeps me busy and on my toes. I'm back to top 20% for *all three* of them. If I'm bored and don't love something, I never learned to put in the discipline because I never had to. I am a good student, but now I'm approaching grad school and I'm comparing myself to those students who love their field beyond compare and have been putting in true effort since they were kids. No, I can't compete with them in their fields.|||Eeh.. systematic derp. I'll edit it later, thanks for noticing!|||Will you be entering labs during the day? Even when not working with chemicals, where I'm from you'd be required to wear a lab coat when entering labs and adhere to the other safety requirements as well. If it's more casual, I think your best bet would be to get some quality dark jeans and some well fitting dress shirts. Keep a blazer in your office and get some nice sweaters you could wear over your dress shirt. With these basics you can go any color really to get some bit of variation in your wardrobe. You can put on the blazer if you have a meeting, or just wear the sweater if your in your office and you're cold. I think good jeans are preferred in a lab environment because of safety issues and in this case wouldn't be to informal if they are actual quality jeans in a nice cut.  I'd also get 1 or 2 dress pants, just black if you get your dress shirts/sweaters in some nice colours. This gives you some more formal options if you have days when it's required. Maybe also get one or two dresses which are work appropriate.For shoes get some nice leather shoes. Perfectly safe for entering a lab and will also fit a more formal look. I can't find nice pictures quickly, but I guess something like [this](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/af/1e/19/af1e19ae73fcfc1b13a7a2921c76c600.jpg).I don't know what you already have, but I think the most important thing would be to get these 'wardrobe essentials' in high quality material and cuts. A well fitting (maybe even take it to a tailor, it's not very expensive) dress shirt will make you look and feel much more professional, even if it would cost you the same as 3 flimsy 'ok looking' shirts.|||Your comment is very complete, but id like to add.. even if OP would go the education route.. the chances of finding work with a sociology degree are very low. I have many sociologist friends with masters degree who couldn't find work. Most are doing call center work now which won't get OP a visa. And you are absolutely right... The only fresh graduates that earn &gt;3100 euros a month would be top of the class university engineering graduates in in demand fields.|||Was going to say this as well. Definitely looks like what they teach at CBT.|||I won't comment on your starting a company idea. It's simply not in my blood and I have simply never understood why people would want to build a company from scratch. It doesn't interest me to the point I find the idea even a bit repulsing so I'm not a good source to ask.Anyway, I do read a lot of self doubt in your post. 'I'm not sure if if now the field well enough' and 'I'm not sure if I can transfer my skills'.I get the self doubts, everyone has them, but maybe this is also the point in your career (if you are indeed interested in running large organizations on an exec level, either corporate or your own) to just take the leap and try exactly one of those jobs you feel slightly not experienced enough for and see where it goes. Maybe you will succeed very well! Great! Maybe you'll fail miserably. Even better! At least in the second scenario you will *actually* have learned something very valuable when it comes to being an exec: the boundaries of the applicability of skill and expertise and what it takes to train people to do jobs dependent on those things.You just reminded me of this anecdote someone once told me. Although the anecdote was meant to display the differences between women en men in leadership, it does apply I guess: Some presenter on a conference asked whether there was an expert in the audience on feeding infants. The only person to raise his hand (even though several mothers were also present) was a man who said: \\\"I watched my wife breastfeed our child for 3 months\\\".My point is: I'm really just a random stranger on the internet judging you on about 500 words worth on this random site, but I'm  getting the feeling it might be time for you to see how far you can stretch your current skills, knowledge and experience to a completely new situation and see how you fare. Why? Simply because that's what I would do in your case.|||I do the same with Moleskine cahiers. It's a perfect method to get nice inserts for a lot cheaper than the original Midori ones... but really, if you are paying 2 dollars to get it cut, you should expect a near perfect cut to the size you want it cut and not a bullshit response like 'I'm afraid to cut your into your Midori notebook'. The job they did on cutting your Clairefontaine is rather bad really, it sticks out almost half a centimeter compared to the original Midori size. (Totally not *your* fault, of course!) A proper copy shop will have methods to line up the cutter to your original notebook and cut the new one to those measurements. If it doesn't, it *really* isn't worth the 2 dollars, which actually is quite a lot of money for what they actually do if you think about it. My super tiny university copy shop cuts my cahiers for me, for free. They don't have all the equipment like a full fledged copy shop, but honestly, they cut them almost perfectly with maybe a 1 millimeter max of a difference to the original.|||Tuition in the UK is like 9k pounds right?You might consider going the the Netherlands for a second BSc. University of Groningen offers STEM BSc degrees in English at 2k euros tuition. Also, you'll be able to learn German as well through the uni.|||Consider long term effects. We all eat to live, let's say everyone eats about 2000 kcal a day. Every bite you take from your friend is a bite he can't have. Although your friend will not miss those 10 kcal of your single bite *that day*, there will come a time where all those bites end up being a days worth of food which your friend will have to 'compensate' for because he *will* miss a days worth of food. Your friend being a passionate meat lover, he will probably do so by buying extra meat products which he wouldn't have bought if you didn't eat his sandwich in the first place. In the end: the meat was bought *for* your albeit not with that intention and you contributed to the meat industry by proxy.|||This is exactly what I've been looking for! How do I add it to Pleco?|||I actually agree with a lot of the commentators quoted in this article. I *really* believe once you make the decision to have kids, they should be your number one priority, above anything else, because they are your FRIKIN KIDS who are totally dependent on you and you have full responsibility for. You can't have kids part time, when you have kids they do indeed become your life because face it, the responsibility of raising another human into this world actually *is* that big! All of this is exactly also the reason why I am childfree.|||Nope, he realized he needed better battery technology for his spaceships and that those would only be produced at the speed needed and quality needed if he was pushing it to his standards, so to make research viable he started Tesla because he realized the same tech would sell (and thus fund the development) in the form of cars. Same story with solar panels, he needed solar panel tech for his spaceships so he started Solar City. Both Tesla and Solar City are companies that serve his higher goal.|||I feel rather confused now. I'm female, and my waist to height ratio is 0.51 while my waist to hip ratio is 0.72.. Both put me in a healthy range according to this article. However, I also have a BMI of 32, which puts me straight in the obese category. With all these conflicting methods, I find it really difficulty to understand what would in fact be a healthy weight for me.|||Thanks anyways for your time though! I appreciate it :)|||I'm guessing - although this is very much my personal oppinion which probably will meet a bit of hate from some people here - that many feminists (or just in general people who want equal rights in society but don't necessarily like to be called feminist) strive for 'equality' but still, maybe subconsciously, consider field traditionally valued more by men as worth more or at least more worth the effort of achieving 'equality' for. Instead of saying: men and women are equal and have similar qualities''  (thus implying men can also be caring and be a nurse for example) the message is very often 'women are equal to men because women can do typical male jobs just as well'.Being a woman in engineering myself this has always bothered me, because I don't want to be seen as a women being good at a mens job thus worthy the same respect and rights.. but more, I'd just like to be acknowledged for having talent and interest in my field and get recognition just for that (just like men do). I'm guessing this goes the other way around as well for men in fields like you mentioned.|||No, he resigned from the kgb when the kgb was still active.|||Where do they stand on their overall score? The Dutch government has this rule to ensure diploma quality is similar to Dutch degrees. Most Dutch uni's are either just below of above world wide overall top 100, not necessarily just in certain fields.|||And the chances of that being English are not that high. Chinese - based on native first language speakers alone, not even considering their economic and academic growth as a country - might very well become the true world wide lingua franca. Or Spanish for that matter, or maybe even in 100-200 years there will be an Esperanto like artificial language, constructed to be as efficient and easy to learn as possible based on the current languages. Maybe you don't realize this as a native English (I'm guessing) speaker, but English is quite a shit language in terms of structure and descriptive power.|||No OP, you do not break up with him just like that. You talk to your SO about what the fuck happened and how it made you feel, *after* that conversation you decide whether you want to stay with him or not. If anything, use this as a learning experience to discuss difficult topics with a SO, be it for the sake of this relationship or the next.|||I've done my own double course load quarters. We don't have mandatory classes in general, except for labs. I simply didn't attend any lectures or tutorials, and got together with my different professors 2-3 weeks *before* classes started to sort out any scheduling conflicts with regard to examinations and labs. This in some cases meant doing parts of a single lab in different groups and classes, but the profs knew me, so I would just present them with my plans of what would fit my schedule and would make sure I'd get through all mandatory stuff, even if it wasn't the conventional route. Once the professors get to know you, they actually were really helpful and just let me do my thing, as long as I didn't bother them and got everything done.|||Maybe a thing to think about: I would try get at fully independent asap, because the car insurance payments are a thing you mother can hold against you as soon as she looses the guilt for you driving your grandma around.|||Lot's of students combine a bachelor in Physics and Astronomy and get both degrees actually. Yeah, it is an added work load, which you need to be up for, but if you think you have an above average intelligence for uni students combined with an above average willingness to commit to your studies and be disciplined about it, it's super doable, without it taking away from other stuff like social life and sports. It's doable because there is quite a bit over overlap between the two degrees when it comes to basic maths and physics. Also, you're EU, so that means that if you decide to enroll for a second degree, you only need to pay tuition fees once. Francken is definitely fun, there is also another association for physics and mathematics, called FMF! Both are also very open to internationals who don't speak Dutch. Also, try to already be settled in Groningen by the time the 'KEI week' starts. It's this big week full of parties and activities to introduce you to student life. You get a chance to have a chat with people from all the different sports associations as well.|||Just commenting to let you know your comment made me feel all happy inside. My SO and I are now mid 20, together for 4.5 years and are planning on staying together for the long run. We faced depression, major health issues, and other ugly stuff together, and it made me realize simply how much *work* it is to keep a relationship healthy and keep it going as strong as it can be. All the endless communicating, opening up and being willing to acknowledge and work on your own ugly sides, all the empathy, all the selfless acts, just to make your SO feel a bit better when your SO is down the hole. Reading comments like yours tells me it's worth it though and that doing this is exactly what will keep us together for decades to come.|||Because my information processions goes from the real world in, instead of projecting my inner vision on the real world.I realized I am super energized by talking to people about a problem and discussion solutions. I get super energized by the process of talking to different people about, superficially, totally different topics, ideas and problems, and realizing they are connected in a way and acting on that connection I found.It's like.. person A tells me about problem X and we discuss it, a few days later person B tells me about how great it would be if we could implement idea Y, then I speak to manager person C about the new overarching strategic goals of my organization and how we lack initiatives related to Z. 2 days later I wake up in the morning, and realize I should open an ice cream parlor that employs clowns as servers as that would unite all those problems and ideas and wishes and would cause for a lot of synergy.That's my COGFUNC_MENTION at work. Although it works on a way larger and comprehensive scale than this stupid example of course.Compare to a TYPE_MENTION with a dominant COGFUNC_MENTION... Take Elon Musk, who has to this big comprehensive system in his mind that tells him his goal in life is to bring humans to Mars. And to achieve this, he started a solar cell company and a car company. Superficially these are totally weird and unrelated moves, but in Elons mind these steps are super logical and all add to the goal of going to Mars. Like I said, I shape the world knowing what I want and by taking in the outside world and see how it's all connected and change it based on that, Elon shapes the world by knowing what he wants and by envisioning how it should and what needs to be be and then changing it on that vision.|||Everyone has option, nobody is forced to do anything, with the only exception that you - if she decides to keep the child - are to pay child support. Unlike others here I (as a woman, if that matters) believe both people who made the baby have a choice in whether on not they will become a parent to the child. Your girlfriend has decided she does not want an adoption, which is absolutely her exclusive right to decide, and has communicated this to you. Now the ball is in your court and you have a decision to make:Do you want to be a parent to this child? If yes: you will need to decide if you want to stay together with your girlfriend and raise the child together, or - if the trust is permanently broken, want to raise the child is shared custody on your own. You are not forced to marry her, you have the option to raise the child alone if that is what you want.If no: you communicate this to her, knowing that the only obligation you have is to pay child support if it comes to it. Per defintion this decision will mean ending the relationship with her and the child altogether. You will be nothing to them but a financial beneficiary. The ball then returns to her court and she can either reconsider having an abortion, decide to put the baby up for adoption or raise the child as a single mother with full custody. This is your life. You have choices. Nobody is forced do anything they don't want. Decisions need to be made of course, but they need to be *your* decisions.|||Your uni should have an international student office. Ask for this, they will have info on all those little pesky details through their experience with all the other international students.|||When I lived on my own in a small studio, I budgeted about 700-750 including rent and excluding tuition fees. Rent was just under 300 euros due to getting some government subsidies, so your figure of about 400 euros a month for all other costs seems quite realistic to me. That is, depending on your healthcare costs, as I would get I think ~80-90 euros a month in government subsidies to help pay for monthly insurance (which in my case was ~120 euros), which brought my health insurance costs down to ~40 euros a month. I can imagine without the subsidy health care costs might put a bit of pressure on your budget.I'm a short female, and would spend about 150 euros a month on food (excluding alcohol). Since that time, I've been greatly reducing the amount of meat I eat. I now live together with my SO, and we have a total budget of 300 euros for the two of use, but what we save from not eating meat goes into some more luxury in terms of food. Frankly, I think if I'd be living on my own with my current eating habits, I could probably feed myself easily for 100 euros a month as well. But again, small female. I lived quite nicely on my budget. I wasn't a huge party goer, but I went to the occasional party, spend quite some nights a month at the pub, did loads of fun stuff with friends. I never had the feeling I missed out due to finances. The amounts /u/Nymerius mentioned in his/her post are pretty much spot on or very close to spot on for most of the categories mentioned in my case. And those are *averages*. I've known a lot of students who lived on less.|||Not said it was easy, but programming is still one of there very few options for which it is considered *feasible* to get work permits abroad.Also, there is simply a shortage in Europe for programmers... most students get picked up by companies during their bachelors because of the high demand, while practically all other students (even STEM) need a masters to be competitive. Many larger programming companies even offer training programmes for jobless people with practically a job guarantee if the programme is completed. Maybe search through this sub.. I remember a post from a few days (maybe a week?) ago from a guy who was talking about a Dutch company who actually actively recruited foreign programmers because of high demand. Surely, there are more companies like that.|||Just something to think about, if you haven't already when it comes to your second paragraph: you want to be a team of two who fight alongside each other. But what happens if your fighter SO will face a burn out, depression or chronic physical illness?I'm ask because I feel the same about my SO and although he is a fighter we had to face a situation where he almost relapsed into depression. These things can happen to everyone. No matter how strong they are, when something like that happens, it feels like the 'fighting together ' is gone and you are fighting full-time alone to help your SO. For me, this was *really* tough. I'm just saying be *aware* that even if you find a strong SO, know that things might happen which make you have to fight alone nonetheless and be prepared to do so for the sake of your relationship.|||You don't really go into your finances. Does your current income cover putting enough money away for your retirement? Are you already putting that money away? Also: if you want children at one point in your life, your current income may not be enough. There are a bunch of these future related financial questions, but I can't really comment on all of this based on your post. If you want some feedback on this part, consider posting in /r/personalfinance but be sure to say you want to know whether it is realistic for you long term to *not* take the job. People over there are quick to jump to the 'more money = best decision' bandwagon.|||You have an amazing girlfriend. :)If you are happy where you are now and you're not struggling financially, I think I'd recommend you to stay where you are. Take that regular who got you through the door for that new job out for a beer to tell him about your decision and keep relationships warm for the future. I do think it would be beneficial for you and your girlfriend to talk some more about future timelines and expectations. In how many years does she want children, when do you want children, and how many? I mean, if she - probably not, but for the sake of the argument - wants children in about 2 years or so... you might *need* to take the other job because kids are fucking *expensive*. Same discussions should be held about owning a house etc. Of, also important: a budget for the wedding and the timeline. Talking about expectations on major life milestones is super important. Knowing you are on the same page and not expecting big expenses anytime soon will certainly ease your mind a lot.By the way, one /r/personalfinance tip: even if (especially if!) you have a lower wage job, an emergency fund of about 3-6 months of regular expenses is super important to have. I don't know your finances, but maybe consider making sure you have this money if something happens unexpectedly.|||Your mum got a Pakistani residence permit because of her marriage? Where is she from originally? Also: there are countries which have sort of capital based residency permits, as in, if you invest enough money into property etc, they'll give you residency. However, these amounts are incredibly high.|||ChemEng here as well.. the thing is, with ChemEng you can work all over the fucking world. So, I think you should consider what you want with your life in terms of being an expat. For example, I want to switch countries every 3 years or so and live all over the place. My strategy is to learn the major world languages to help me with this (French, Spanish, English, German, Arabic and Chinese). But, if you for example feel specifically drawn to a certain region (Scandinavia for example) and want to settle there for a longer period of time, it makes more sense to start learning Norwegian, even if you end up in Sweden.|||What is bothering me about those people is the fact that they don't even consider that *this woman stole OP's opportunity to be a father figure for this child*. By 8+ years old the child will not bond with OP as she would have had at a younger age. I do wonder, whether - because he wasn't informed - OP can claim parental rights and claim his daughter for a 50/50 custody arrangement.|||Listen, I really think you are misunderstanding the 'demand' for languages in the EU. Most Europeans speak at least two languages already fluently, most speak 3 or 4 EU language at professional proficiency if they are higher educated and there are even quite a lot of people who speak more than 5 languages. Most European high schools start teaching their kids additional language from the age of 12 onwards, some school systems even earlier. There simply is not a 'demand' for someone who speaks several language, if anything it is simply *expected* for university level job seekers. That's why the number 1 advice for US people coming the the EU is to start learning the local language right now, years before they get here, because without it's simply hopeless|||She simply doesn't understand because she can't even start to image parents not being absolutely loving and caring towards their children. Why don't you find yourself some similar stories to your situation from /r/raisedbynarcissists to show her so she can read about what kind of a mother she is and that it is actually quite common to have such parents. It's not just your mother, it's a lot of peoples parents who act like this!|||I agree, there is zero reason to stay in abusive relationships even a day longer. HOWEVER, this sub is awfully quick to recommend dumping your partner. I think it is important to realize no relationship is perfect, because the people in it are by definition imperfect humans. Good relationships simply take a lot of work and if you value your relationship the 10% rule simply feels right in terms of how long you can realistically expect a person to stand and fight for the relationship.|||But you were allowed to work there right? That's because of the non-EEA family visa laws. The bureaucracy is a bitch, but in de end they still allowed you to work under that visa. There a many countries in which the non-EEA spouse is only allowed to work under *much* stricter conditions compared to the EU law (if you are settling in the country of origin of your EU spouse). In that case, national law supersedes EU law, that's why a third country if often a lot easier.|||My MIL is an amazingly kind woman. At one point she found an excuse to get my number ('Oh what's your number again, I'll WhatsApp you this picture we talked about' or whatever it was). With that private line of communication open we got to talk among ourselves, instead when only my SO was with us. My MIL would diligently write down all the stuff I said after we'd leave from a visit. Things like when I would go for a weekend trip, when I had to do a major exam, when I had my next appointment with my surgeon at the hospital. Then, before my appointment or whatever it was, she'd app me 'Good luck, hope everything will be OK' or before I left on my weekend away 'Have fun, can't wait to hear all about it!'. And afterwards she would always follow up and ask how it went. I have an OKish relationship with my parents, but my mother is too much of a narc to even remember my hospital appointments. It's not even an issue of remembering the exact date, she simply doesn't ask about it *ever*. When I started to build a relationship with my MIL, I felt so cared for, so loved. And I know, if I'd were to ever break up with my SO his parents would stand by him of course, but while we are together, they see me as family and love me as family.|||I think this in general is true, but the Faculty of Science and Engineering where OP will be studying is a big exception to this, considering social life is much more focussed around the study associations opposed to the student associations and the FSE study associations are incredibly open and inclusive to internationals compared to city wide standards.|||As much as it makes so much sense, I am kind of sad, because this will probably mean I will not learn any sign language.. I can't see myself living in the same country for more than maybe 4-5 years before moving to another corner of the world. Learning sign language will mean a significant investment in a language I will likely not use a lot. Thank you for clarifying this though!|||Just note that if the reason you're not getting married is because of personal reasons surrounding the legal arrangements of marriage, a civil union won't help you. In most European countries the legal rights and obligations are the same or at least *very* similar when comparing unions and marriages.|||If you use fountain pens, forget it, Moleskine isn't the choice for you. I like the paper, it's a bit off white, which makes it softer on the eyes for me, but the paper is rather thin. I use fine liners and I'm able to see the ink from the other side of the page.. Midori paper doesn't have this issue. I don't care for it really and if you'd use ball pens you might not notice at all. Moleskine isn't the best, but in the case of Midori alternatives, they are really good for their price. The cahiers sell at about 10 dollars/euros for a 3-pack, so about 3-4 dollars a piece, which is like half the price of a midori insert. Plus, they are really readily available in practically every bookstore.|||What do you both teach and at which level? What about foreign languages proficiency of you, your wife Ã¡nd the kids?|||Cool, I did not know this. Thanks!|||I agree, if you want to make a *proper* clean break you'll need that many years. But the EU won't allow it and will play nasty games to push to UK to trigger article 50 rather sooner than later, because first and foremost as long as this isn't arranged the economic market of the whole EU is down because of economic uncertainty and the EU has a lot of incentive to push for quick resolutions at the cost of the UK because when the UK fails on its own other countries will be deterred from wanting their own independence. That's why Merkel and the French politicians are pushing so hard for the UK to trigger article 50 as soon as possible.|||Didn't you also say in your original post you only get 4 to 5 hours of sleep on a regular day and that's why it's bothering so much because you want to sleep in on the weekends? Getting some proper sleep during the week may also solve a lot of your own sleeping issues.|||At an art meets technology event in my city there was an artist who hooked up scanner to a machine like this one that could draw pancakes with 4 different colours. Kids could stop by and make a crayon drawing with the 4 colours the pancake printer could print in and the kids could get their own drawing made into an edible pancake. Was rather cool.|||For now, do yourself the favour of preparing a go bag. This is a rucksack or whatever which contains enough clothing for a few days to get you going and *all* relevant documents and items which you might need in the case of *not being able to ever go home again*. This sounds extreme, but you'll be really glad in the case you do ever find yourself in the situation you simply need to leave *now*. So what goes in the bag for example: ID (passport, birth certificate, etc), money (cash and any cards, cheque books), medication if any also additional lenses/glasses, a burner phone, house/car keys, any important legal documents (such as your lease!).When that is done, you have at least some piece of mind of being able to leave at any time you want and still have all you need with you. This gives you some breathing space to look online for women's shelters, not necessarily to go to, because that might be a haunting thought right now, but to contact so they can guide you through the best course of action right now. Also, especially if you are in the US, get yourself a lawyer (without your partner knowing of course) just to have legal council ready and prepped in case you need it.|||So, this happens every year on the 4th of May in the Netherlands. Ever since we were liberated from Nazi occupation. Today we remember our dead, tomorrow we celebrate our freedom. All cars stop, even on the motorways. All busses stop. All trains will make a full stop as well, no matter where they are. I was having dinner at a restaurant when 8 o clock came around. All staff stood in front of the bar, service stops and the whole restaurant goes silent. People randomly walking on the streets will stop and stand in silence. Cities across the country, universities and other public institutions will hold ceremonies and place flowers to remember those who died close to them. For two minutes, the country goes silent, and the only thing you'll hear is the wind and a random dog bark. In some ways, it always feels apocalyptic to me. Which, I guess must have been reality to those subjected to war.|||As I said earlier, I absolutely support that more options to abandon parenthood need to be available.. but your argument seems very similar to one that's often shit upon in another context.. which is that there is a difference in equality of rights versus equality of outcome. Equal rights (the kind of egalitarianism I support) will not necessarily lead to equal outcome, simply because there *are* inherent differences between genders.|||Not too many mainland uni's that offer English courses at BSc level, my university is one of the very few predominantly English taught universities. Have a look: University of Groningen in the Netherlands. With an EU passport, tuition runs at 2k a year, which is more expensive than let's say Germany, but way cheaper than the UK.|||Oh wow... this really is spot on.|||20 something European person. I have seriously never seen a check in my life. If it wasn't for American TV shows, I wouldn't have know what they were growing up.|||I like Moleskine, I use them exclusively. My small pocket notebook goes with me everywhere. My friend likes Leuchtturm, she also takes hers everywhere. Her notebook however is totally falling apart, while mine isn't. I don't know.. I didn't really get the impression that Leuchtturm is really much sturdier than Moleskine.|||Started with Chemical Engineering (how do we build this reactor?), added Industrial Engeering with a focus on production engineering (how do we organize this plant?), added Business Administration with a focus of supply chain and operations (where do we build plants and how do we get everything we need for that plant to that place?).  Easentially, I made myself a big fat engineering sandwich ideal for multinational engineering management in which I linked specialist knowledge on how to make the product to what is needed to actually produce the product efficiently. In engineering, there is an extreme shortage of people who *want* to go into management, so that's what I focused on.|||You don't have to enroll for the second degree right away, you can do that at a later time while still taking additional courses that will count towards the second degree.I'm not a physics students, I'm from the chemistry department and also do two degrees (even planning to get 3 degrees at a time, but had to quit 1 due to health issues)... I am a super strong advocate for students to get most out of their time in Groningen, be it through extra degrees or being very heavily involved in student boards or representative bodies, or volunteering, or anything else that you deem worthwhile of your time. Whatever it takes to get students to work at the absolute top of their abilities and push them to become the best they can. I didn't get much help back in the day and had to figure out everything on my own when I wanted to do a second degree. I truly, *truly* believe that if you think you can handle two degrees, you should start from day one in your first year. I've helped quite a few incoming students to set up their study programmes to accommodate multiple degrees and help them through the administrative burden of getting everything arranged properly. This included a student who wanted to combine a full physics and chemistry degree, so I am familiar with the physics programme. You know what, just think about it. Once you get here and you decided you are seriously interested in doing both degrees, shoot me a PM and we'll meet up for a beer or something to discuss your options.|||I have a couple of friends with similar problems and holy shit this is a huge accomplishment, especially considering the party probably was very unfamiliar territory with a lot of strangers!You should be super proud of yourself. Do yourself a favour and write down you memories of that party in detail somewhere. Write down how you felt, how you reacted to difficult moments etc etc and keep it somewhere to read again when you face a similar situation that doesn't go as smoothly as this one. Knowing you did it once and forcing yourself to remember is can be a tremendous lifeline if you feel down some other time.|||I disagree. There is one very specific thing that can be done and is incredibly effective to cull this behaviour: Men who believe in gender equality should call out other men on their sexist behaviour. The thing is.. Look, I'm a woman, and if a man is sexist, me telling that man his behaviour is inappropriate won't change anything, because the guy is sexist and as such disregards my opinion without a second thought. But if another *man* calls him out that his behaviour is ridiculous and inappropriate, usually the sexist men feel ashamed for being called out by their own equal. I talk about this issue a lot with the men I come across. To those who care for women and who bring up instances of them noticing women being treated badly because of their sex by fellow men I ask outright to speak up next time. Just like I speak up against other women who are condescending about men being stay at home parents or make sexist rapist jokes etc. Part of egalitarianism is fighting the fight towards true equality *together*.|||Hmm, interesting. I have not heard about specializing in nanotech as an engineer, as to me nanotech is mostly material science related which I always associated with chemistry and physics.Anyways, my university runs a highly selective master in nanoscience. If selected it's practically a guaranteed (salaried) PhD position. However.. it's not engineering based. Contact me if you want further info on the programme, i'll send you some links.|||Just take her to a good store, it most likely won't take more than 20-25 minutes if it isn't busy to walk away with 2 properly fitting bra's. Do expect to pay some money for them though.|||Not OP, but I think it is pretty much impossible to work full time next to an engineering master, which takes 2 years full time, with probably full time research most of your second year. There is very little support for students who want to study part time in general in the EU. (for example online colleges or whatever).Also, you'd need to figure out visas. If you get here on a student visa, you'd only be allowed to work a very limited number of hours. If you get here on an employer sponsored visa, I'm not sure if you'd be allowed to enroll at a university with one.|||If your polish ID card allows European travel, then yes. Most national ID cards allow this, so I'm guessing the Polish one as well. Just Google the polish gov sites whether your ID is an official EU travel document. (Remember, UK is still part of the EU as of now, and although not part of Schengen, as part of the EU they do allow free movement of EU nationals.)|||I just posted something about my experiences with my parents to another topic.. maybe it's something for here as well, maybe not. Take it for what it is, maybe it applies to your children as well: I am 21 and haven't always had the most stable relationship with my parents. Now that I'm growing into adulthood I'm having issues coming to realize my parents are not *just* mum and dad but Jane Doe and John Doe with their own history, fears and dreams. They are their own persons and not just that whatever a mum or dad *should* be. It's difficult for me to develop a relationship with them that goes beyond just mum and dad, because frankly, I'm more or less starting my own family now and they are not the traditional mum and dad figures anymore in my life who are feeding and raising me. It scares me, really, because I suddenly need to develop relationships with people I care deeply for, but also at many times feel like stranger to me. I also am really mourning childhood and how easy and simple life used to be. Growing up sucks.|||Going forward I think you should really determine for yourself before you go to conferences and such with what kind of goal your going there. If you are going there to get work connections, don't start talking about religion and relationships and all that personal stuff with people you just met. Keep to topics work related and when the conversations become too personal, steer them back to work topics. I'm incredibly close the the higher ups in my own little field, and through the years I've talked to them about these things, but that took years and followed after we had a solid professional relationship first. I think this is especially important when reputation is super important in your field like you said. Also I'm not trying to victim blame here, but your field sounds male dominated from the way you described is (mine too, engineering), and sadly, it's simply more difficult for women to be taken seriously in such fields and it may be crappy, but as woman in such a field, you need to actively be concerned with how you are perceived by male peers.. in the end you should be careful about your *own* reputation as well. In general: try to keep conversations more work related when one of one and only go more personal either in group settings in which you an divide focus between all the people in the group or when you get the know an individual (a lot) better. I would not stop going to the social outings, those are super important for networking opportunities, but watch your own alcohol consumption, and again, move around and actively divide attention among the people present. This will make sure you don't give off any vibes you didn't mean to give off to those men to begin with and will hopefully prevent what has happened with this event. I know it sucks, and we both wish it shouldn't be necessary, but this is the sad reality of many professional women.|||Can you give some specific cases? The context will be important in giving you a good deflective example answer.|||Personally I don't expect article 50 to be triggered sometime soon, maybe somewhere around the new year. I also honestly still very much see the possibility of shit hitting the fan big time in the coming which will make parliament disregard the referendum altogether (which isn't in any way binding to begin with, remember).|||Social life is super diverse, and we don't really make a hard distinction between undergrad and grad students. Mainly also due to history, as in the Netherlands a bachelor + masters are still very much considered one package.What will you be studying?|||Dank voor je antwoord.Je laatste vraag is lastig te beantwoorden. Ik denk dat anderen die mij kennen zouden zeggen dat het ambitie en prestatiedrang is, maar voor mij persoonlijk is het dat niet. Ambitie en prestatiedrang zijn voor mij heel erg naar buiten gekeerde redenen om iets te willen bereiken, prestige, geld, status etc. Maar voor mij is het een hele intrisieke drijfveer juist. Ik ben erg onrustig en kan niet stil zitten en rustig aan doen in mijn leven. Een constante drang om alles uit elke dag te halen wat ik kan. Het harde werken is iets waar ik gelukkig van wordt, tevreden met mezelf mee ben als ik dan in bed lig. Ik kan helemaal ethousiast worden van een bepaald project of een functie en dat grijpt me dan volledig en dan ga ik er helemaal in op. Het is alsof me mezelf elke dag de vraag stel: als ik vandaag dood neer val, ben ik dan tevreden met met leven geweest en heb ik alles eruit gehaald wat ik kon? En ik doe mijn best om iedere dag die vraag met ja te beantwoorden.Daarbij komt dat ik door een trial and error van veel van dit soort projecten in de afgelopen jaren nu ongeveer 1.5 jaar weet wat voor soort werk mij ECHT gelukkig maakt, dat doet het bovenstaande met me, maar dan ervaar ik dat nog 20x zo intensief.|||Just go with the flow, do everything you are able to do today instead of tomorrow, don't worry about tomorrow and if you do fuck up: you did everything you could have done anyway so no point in blaming yourself, just keep going and find a solution.And yeah, like I said: plan every-fucking-thing. I've dealt with my share of double planned exams. So I check those the moment the schedules are posted so I can switch around courses in my multiyear plan and do another course without schedule conflicts instead. If minor things overlap, presentations or whatever, I go to the professor at day 1 (or even before) of the course and they are always open to find a solution, because you're actually on time to request something like this. (They deal with a shitload of idiots who visit their offices a few days before a deadline with a story about why they can't make it, even if they knew weeks or months in advance.) Always be patient and grateful if professors are willing to adjust their course for you. I even went as far as to send a handwritten thank you card to a professor who *really* went out of his way to accomodate me. Staff really appreciate you appreciating them and their valuable time. Also: for me, being able to do this means a constant analysis of time spend effectively. If I don't think the lectures go fast enough or aren't interesting/informative enough to allow the slower pace, I don't go and spend that time learning the material myself. Any meetings I plan for projects or extracurriculars I usually chair myself and are always prepared and have a proper agenda to discuss everything in as little time as possible. If you take the lead and spend 30 minutes preparing a meeting and as a result, you'll be able to discuss everything in 1 hr instead of meeting twice for 1 hr because everyone is fucking around, that still saved you 30 minutes.Also: I don't aim for the highest grades, believing my extra degrees will more than off set me not having *cum laude* diploma averages.|||Education is everything. The only visas that are relatively easy to get are educational visas. Don't just do your best, try to improve and become even better every single day.|||So is it @fakedomain.org or hacked @realdomain.org? Easy first step if it's a fake domain: run the domain through a whois website to get some info on the registrar etc and maybe you luck out and the imposter actually attached their real name to their domain registration.|||It's like a masters programme, like a MSc in Europe. Sadly, student visas are still the easiest way in, but usually also very expensive. Especially is the US where tuition fees are easily several tens of thousand of dollars a year. Another option would be to very aggressively pursue jobs with large multinational companies which have a large market in the US. Surely you'll find plenty in Istanbul/Ankara or other large cities. After a few years at such a company you may be able to get yourself relocated.|||I actually had a midnight conversation about this with my SO. My head and personality are always focused on the future, to me, all I do, should benefit me tomorrow, that's just how I roll. My SO is very much 'I'll probably be dead in 5 year because of a freak accident so I need to live now'. Naturally, this is a bit of a struggle in terms of philosophical opinions regarding FI and how to get there. We are both students now. We have some money, not a lot, but enough to enjoy ourselves. We save up to travel and make it a point to have a proper date night once or twice a month. I think, we have about 1400 euros to spend a month for the two of us in total. We talked about what will change once both of us start working. And the way I think we will satisfy both our lives, is by never forgetting the value of a single euro and making sure to be cautious about lifestyle creep. We have a one bedroom now, which we are both super happy with. We could easily live there for a couple of years when we both start our careers, we don't *need* a bigger apartment. This will make sure our monthly expenses will stay similar to what they are now. Then we realized.. if we'd work, we could live for example on 2000-2200 euros a month while still saving *a lot* and holy shit... that's another 400 euros a month *per person* in spending money. We could do a city trip to a new city every frikin month with that kind of money! *Every month!* That's the feeling I hope to retain throughout my adult life once the promotions roll in etc.|||Poland is EU right? For example I'm Dutch, and our Dutch national IDs allow for travel within the EU + EEA. It actually says on the card itself. Maybe it's the same for polish ID and its also on the back of your ID?. Else, check the polish gov sites for confirmation.|||The first few sentences in I was like: just tell this guy on facebook (or a non-face to face situation) that you do not like being touched whatsoever by him and kindly ask him to refrain from doing so. I was thinking.. this guy is just a bit oblivious and needs to be told straight to his face you don't like his behaviour.. That was before I read about him groping your crotch and breasts, and him stealing your phone to show you intimate pictures to others without your consent.This guy is not your friend. I repeat: this guy is **not** your friend. He knows DAMN well what he is doing and what he is doing is (sexually) harassing you. This is not a friendship. You should could contact completely.|||Except in this case you'll be repaying the loan to the Dutch government and if you earn below minimum income (about 1700 euros a month before taxes) you don't have to repay it at all. And even if you earn more, it's only a maximum of 4 percent of the income you earn that is above minimum income. Any outstanding loan after 35 years will be waived by the government. So even if all else fails, it's still rather save.|||Welcome! I'll introduce you right away to one of the favorite topics the Dutch like to talk about: complaining about the weather.I snickered when I read this part of the blog:With winter rapidly encroaching... Good luck with the Dutch weather! Wind as your enemy? You'd better become friendly with the wind asap! You'll soon be riding your bike through freezing temperatures and rain storms. Or when it starts to snow... let's not start talking about snow... No trains when it snows, traffic jams everywhere... when it snows your bike will be the only way to get somewhere. But you'll also have a lot of fun! The Netherlands really is great. Many Dutch holidays are coming up as well. 'Sint Maarten' in November and 'Sinterklaas' early December for example.|||Ah, got it! Looks good, seems like you indeed still have the right to your Italian passport. Do you live in a major US city? The big cities usually have their own embassies, just email them and ask them which documents you need to hand in. Don't forget to ask about the fee, could be several hundreds. That what I did for my second nationality (not IT though) and the embassy was very helpful.|||Honestly? I've cheated my way through most of my homework. Never reports or exams, but homework I simply don't care about.Frankly, for me it's a matter of principle: don't force me to learn the material in a specific way. Usually homework counts for very little, but is still mandatory to be able to do your exam. And I get it, for 80% of the students this setup works and is necessary, I really do get it, but it's simply not how *I prefer to learn* and at that point, those homework sets are an absolute waste of time and I could be doing other things with my life.|||Go! If she is your world and you are hers, you guys will find a way. It will be hard, but on a life together a few years will be nothing, while these few years at this job may have a very large effect on the rest of your life and career.|||I'm curious. I'm European myself and speak quite a few European language, but I never came across this attitude. If you don't mind, where are you from?|||MBTI *is* 'fake' in the sense that statistical research has concluded it provides no predictive personality model. There are much better models to be found if this is your goal, for example the Big Five. However, the fact that MBTI isn't a proper predictive or explanatory model in the scientific sense, doesn't mean MBTI can't be *valuable* nonetheless. For me, it has given me some great insights in understanding how my way of experiencing the world is fundamentally different than the experiences of many other. It also helped my understand the thought processes of those dear and close to me, and made me a better friend, relative and partner to them because MBTI helped me understand them better. MBTI also made me aware of some points of improvement regarding me and my character, which to me is also very valuable as it made me a better person for it. So no.. scientifically, MBTI is indeed bullshit. But on a personal level, it can still be valuable.|||I agree with this onion observation... I'm TYPE_MENTION and this is exactly the case for me. If you want to find us: ask around. For me, I'm very involved in student participation efforts at my university, so a lot of people know me. I think if you'd ask around asking questions like 'name a woman who you think would be future CEO material' my name would pop up among a few others I feel are TYPE_MENTION/TYPE_MENTION, and if you'd ask further there would be quite a few people who love me, but also quite a few who'd hate me and everything in between, with an overall consensus that at least I'm good at running this joint and even those who hate me respect me for it.|||I learned to not give a shit about what people think and be honest.I am *incredibly* introverted in the sense that social interaction is incredibly draining and exhausting. Honestly, I'm surprised I'm actually functioning as a human being. But I do like the social interaction that comes with your business example of getting things done and the COGFUNC_MENTION energy I get from it compensates the energy drain from having to socialize.But with 'no goal' social interactions I'm just really upfront in telling people:I'm going home, I'm not enjoying myself any more at this party, it's just too busy right now.You guys go out together, I'll stay here at our cabin and read a book, I don't feel like going out today. Etc.Anyway, like I said: I'm up front and honest about what I'm about, even if it's about the negatives of my personality. Note the more feeling based type of choice of words. The rationals who get me, get me, the feelers who are worried about me are calmed by the type of language I use. And I'm consistent with my message: social interaction asks a lot of me, and I'm ok with that, so just let me be and I'll join when I can and want to.|||I guess we simply disagree in that case, which is fine. Thank you for explaining your viewpoint though, I appreciate it. I truly believe that to be a good parent, your child needs to come first and be your top priority, even if it comes at the cost od your own happiness because frankly, you have a bigger responsibility than being happy, you are raising a human being into adulthood. And I feel staying in a relationship which you know will end one time is selfish toward that child who relies on their parents and parental figures like OPs partner for everything and is heavily bonded with your partner. In that case, I feel you are choosing your own needs over that of your child, which I think is not OK.These idea of what good parenthood *should* be in my opinion is why I don't want kids. I'm simply not willing put my hypothetical childs happiness before my own.Edit: in your case, it would probably have been in our interest as a child if your mum divorced your dad.. I'm not saying staying together is always the best option, but I don't think your story can be compared to OPs case. I'm actually recommending OP ends it sooner rather than later, because it's better for the kid if they do.|||Then again, this is - I think - exactly the point of going through your 20s. Before your 20s you were a child, and in many ways only an extension of your parents as a moving wheel in the family unit without there being much else you can identify with. It's only in our 20s when we become independent and are left what we at our core, and deal with it when we don't like it.|||How do you feel about the possibility of you giving birth to a child who has autism, down syndrome or any (severe) physical disability? What if it meant your child would never grow up to be an independent adult and will need care for the rest of its life? How would you deal with that? I commented on this thread as well, and this was one of the big reasons why I don't want children, because I couldn't and don't want to deal with such a situation. Just wondering how a fellow TYPE_MENTION female of similar age who does want children thinks about this.|||It's not selfish, you fell for the guy and the rules changed during the game. It isn't just him anymore, it's him plus his child and the child isn't going away. What are you going to do?|||I guess the thing that was *shocking* about it was realizing how US employers treat their people like disposable income generators, with no care for them whatsoever, instead of like, you know, human people.|||hahaha, this is *so* typical. I have been having the same discussion with my SO as well. Whenever my SO asks me 'Do you mind if I go to friend X / Do you mind if friend X comes over' or whatever, I kept telling him ' ... you don't have to ask me permission, you know.'Anyway, my SO sat me down and told me he didn't appreciate me constantly telling him he doesn't need 'permission', because for him, it wasn't about asking permission, it was about showing respect and consideration, and by telling him off for asking 'permission' he felt that I did not appreciate the fact that he tried to put me first. As he explained it to me, he will ask me if I'd mind these things, *before* he made plans with other people, because he thinks it's important to put me and our shared need as partners first. If there was something going on he wasn't aware off, either conflicting plans on my part or even if I'd just rather have him home tonight because I felt like it, he wanted to give me the chance to voice that so he could just tell his friend he can't visit tonight, instead of having to go back with a 'sorry dude, the girlfriend already has plans, I need to cancel on you'. He would find it disrespectful towards me if he would have to cancel *because* of me (and hurt my standing with his social circle because of it) instead of talking about our shared plans and coming up with the conclusion *together* to stay home or whatever, because in that case, he will simply tell his friends 'sorry dude, I already got plans'. After he explained this, I actually really started to appreciate this line of reasoning, and even though I will still 'state' my plans if I planned them way in advance, for any short term arrangements, I will also ask him whether he minds my plans, to also show him he's my priority in my social life.|||I vs E in MBTI has nothing to do with the 'social exhaustion' definition of introversion. In MBTI, I and E tell something about how the direction of mental energy for a person. TYPE_MENTION usually get their mental energy from engaging with others, it makes the idea mill run. And TYPE_MENTION makes their idea mill run by reflection on issues internally. If you want to know more, read up about cognitive functions. Comparing TYPE_MENTION vs TYPE_MENTION you'll see that TYPE_MENTION have 'extraverted thinking' as dominant function and TYPE_MENTION 'introverted intuition'. This explains what I mentioned above.Now for social exhaustion, the feeling of having to 'recharge' from being around people: for me absolutely daily. I need several hours divided all over the day of quiet time every day in which I am not disturbed and talked to. My long term SO is TYPE_MENTION, he is both MBTI introverted and social exhaustion introverted. We often joke how I am so much extremely more introverted than he is, while he's the MBTI introvert.|||Hey beautiful! You will get through this, I know you will. I've had 2 good friends that went through eating disorders when I was your age (early 20s now) and it was tough and awful, not for me, but for them. But we stood strong together, cried together, sometimes I had to drag my friends' buts to their counselor when they refused. But we kept taking a single new step forward every day. My friends are doing amazing now. One is almost done with grad school and is  trying to get a PhD position in a very competitive field and will probably succeed. My other friend - after trying - figured out a traditional degree isn't for her and went to art school and is more happy now than she's ever been. You are amazing. You will stand strong. You will survive. And life will be fucking *amazing*. Lots of love.|||Over the past years I slowly gained more and more weight. I started studying (so many parties, and so much beer) and at one point I got chronically ill needing half a dozen of surgeries in under two years, leaving me rather bound to bed and in a lot of pain. All of this contributed to a continuous but slow weight gain.I was visiting my mum at one point who I only see every other month or so, and over dinner she said: 'are you on new medication of something? You look very puffy in your face. ' this hit a really wrong nerve, and I just blurted out that it was because I got fat. The thing is, I have quite an awesome body fat distribution with a good hourglass figure, so I never really felt fat. But when I got home and took a long look in the mirror, I saw my mum was right, because my face did start to get puffier and fatter. It got to me, and kick-started me to do something about it.|||I've been living together with my SO for just over 6 months. This is our first real 'home', before this, we both had two tiny student studios.I never expected this, but *damn*, running a household is *hard*. The dishes pile up, the laundry piles up, and if we both have a shit day or two, and don't so daily clean ups, we need to plan time to tidy up again. Shit's not easy.Anyway, being grateful for small successes is a huuuge motivator. Every time I come home and I see my SO did the dishes out of his own initiative I tell him: 'Oh wow, you did the dishes, thank you, I really appreciate it!' and he does the same when he gets home and I did the laundry or whatever.This makes it so much easier to get into the habit of having a nice, clean house. It actually makes me happy to do chores now, instead of seeing it as something I dread.|||I have a closet full of A-line (think 50s) dresses in all kinds of prints, from colorful florals to subtle graphical prints. The dresses fall right on my knees, so they cover myself enough to also wear them to work. They take no effort whatsoever to put on, and because they are a bit out of the ordinary, people do turn their heads and generally give me a lot of compliments on them (also because my figure fits the A-line style really wel I guess). I am so very not a morning person, to know I can just put on 1 single item of clothing and some heels, and be ready to go, just feels amazing and stress free.I have a wide range of shoes, I'm different models and such, but they are *all* quality black leather, meaning they go with everything that's in my wardrobe. This also removes stress. The same with my bag, which is a collection of different sizes of quality cognac coloured leather, which I rotate based on their purpose that day. My work bag gets most action, so my stuffs always in that one, meaning I also don't have to worry about bags and just pick my bag from wherever I put it down in the evening and go.I am super lucky though to have amazing hair that requires almost no grooming at all to look good, although it being very log and curly. I just shake my hair around a bit, put in a bun, or not, *maybe* some product and I'm good to go. Most of the days I don't even have to comb my hair. This *also* saves me a bunch of time.|||I think a calorie tracker app on your phone would be the easiest to use, and at the end of the day, you can simply write down total calorie intake in your BuJo for that date's entry (if you follow the classic BuJo system - indicates a simple note). Same for exercise. Just make a simple note: - 20 squats, ran 5 km at 10km/h. Things like recipes etc will clog down your BuJo, because that's not something that's a quick reference. I think I'd put that in a separate journal, same for quotes and traditional journaling etc if you will be doing that daily. Maybe you should look for a type of notebook called a commonplace book! Your lists (maybe also think about gift ideas for your friends/SO/kids/parents) can be super useful as a collection in your BuJo.|||Do you live in one of the Dutch cities with a university? Many university offer language courses, maybe your parents are willing to pay for you to take some proper Chinese lessons?I saying this because at 13, you probably just started maybe also learning a bit of French or German at school. You probably also learned English rather naturally when growing up through watching cartoons and stuff. At 13, you don't have a lot of experience with learning a language without natural exposure in childhood. This means you'll approach the language learning process a lot more formally through grammar and such instead of through play and experimentation. Being able to do so simply requires some experience which you may not have yet (but will!). This can make learning a new language without guidance and lessons very difficult.|||I think that's why it's important speak about things every day, not just when emotions have run high. Even depressed people have better days. If you talk daily, yes, in the beginning he'll talk more because he has more 'catching up' to do considering his illness.. but after that's done, there will be more space for you as well. Also find friends etc to talk to about your relationship. Friends to cry with and to vent to.|||Your name is really fitting. :)|||Until you actually get to know Dutch culture and find out how ingrained it is in our culture not to stand out. We have a saying 'niet boven het maaiveld uitsteken' which could translate to 'Don't stick your head out of the cornfield' or something. Meaning: the Dutch culture is this super mediocrity, any deficiency from the norm (especially, being better than the norm) is really not looked at favourably. Society really pushes everyone to the norm, ambition and standing out is *not* encouraged. Nonetheless, it's an amazing safe, clean and good country to live in. It's just.. this part of society definitely does not fit an TYPE_MENTION's personality.|||The people in their 20s who naturally take responsibility of their community, dare to speak up and lead. I think those are the type of people who will find themselves progressing towards management as the years pass, simply because managing people and organizations comes natural to them and they already self-identify as leader types during their development in their young adulthood.|||All of the above!OP, you really should go on those introduction camps, it's a great way to get to know people! I really suggest you try to invest some time in going to activities organised by your study association (they are called 'Cover') and get a social circle at the association instead of going to ESN like many internationals do? Why? Because it will give you an opportunity to really integrate into the social circle that belong to your study (including getting to know a lot of Dutch people), instead of mixing up with a bunch of random internationals only. If you struggle with anything during your degree, being friends with a few higher year students will be absolutely godsend. The people at Cover are also very friendly and open to internationals like the poster above already said.|||Download Civ 5 or something similar on your computer and see the weeks pass before your eyes.|||Ok, you've got enough hate about the cream cheese issue already, so instead I'll answer this in general terms of how things go in my relationship.I come from a very 'quiet' home where nobody every raised their voice and if someone did, that meant somebody fucked up BIG TIME. As a result, I am super sensitive towards voice raising, because to me, someone yelling says there is a very, *very* big problem and someone is *very* angry.My SO grew up in a 'loud' home on top of him and his dad being partially deaf. He also has anger/aggression issues for which he was treated by a psych before we met. Anyway, my boyfriend is often rather loud, not outright yelling, but really loud when he is feeling emotional.When this happens, I want to sit in a corner with a blanket over my head and wait out the storm so to say. I hate it. Absolutely hate it.So, how do we deal with this: we talk. Not when he is angry, but when we are both calm the day after. He never realized how him raising his voice came across, because to him, its just expression frustration. It took quite a few good conversations for him to truly understand what is was doing to me, because he honestly did not see any harm as he didn't have any harmful intentions.Anyway, how do I know he's a good guy and not abusive? He's a good guy because he puts in a lot of effort to change his behaviour because it effects me so much. It's very difficult for him, but he has made progress and more importantly, when he does lose his cool, he simply goes away for a walk or goes to another room to cool off so he won't affect me with it. And this is the absolute defining moment which makes him a *good guy*: when he comes back, he tells me he's **sorry**, an honest and truly meant sorry, and promises to do better in the future and work on himself. **And he actually makes true on that promise.**|||Because really, the mere thought that a woman who got accepted at a US university based on her own merit *might* be intelligent and talented enough to get her own career running and apply for her own goddamn work visa is impossible to even consider, is it?|||How is more presentable and welcoming? I really struggle to understand this. Sitting down would not prevent the cashier to greet me and smile at me, it would not prevent them from properly and quickly scanning my products either. What does standing up in this case subconsciously convey to you as opposed to sitting down?|||I personally think narcissism is not typical for TYPE_MENTION, we are too rational and narcissism in its core is a very *emotional* egocentric disorder. But we probably all are a bunch of sociopaths though.|||It's difficult. Really realizing that it was not my job to cure my SO and help him through this, as he had to do this on his own, was the first step. You need to truly understand this. Between writing this post and your comment, my SO had a massive anxiety attack. Full blown panic, he couldn't do anything. I went to see his psych together again, for the first time since he started. I asked her this question as well. She said that the trick was that the moment a full blown panic attack is happening, both of us are way too late to help. We just need to sit it out and wait for the panic to pass. The trick is making sure it doesn't get to that stage. If I notice my SO is starting to struggle, I tell him he should take his psych notebook and go work on his CBT exercises like, right now, on his own. Sure, he can come back and talk to me about it if he can't get through the exercise because his mind is stuck, but he's the one who needs to work for it. Luckily, me SO really realizes that he needs to do the heavy lifting and that this is the only way he'll get better, so he is not resisting treatment. I can imagine that's not the case with all patients.|||I'm Dutch with multiple nationalities (jus sanguinis). The Dutch state doesn't even know about my other nationalities because I'm not required to provide that info. You won't be either. You'll get to the Netherlands on a Romanian passport, as you'll be using EU freedom of movement. You'll register yourself at your Dutch municipality as Romanian because of freedom of movement. You'll register yourself as Romanian at your uni because lower tuition fees. The Dutch state will not ask for your US nationality. Anyway, your VOG is also only checked against Dutch justice department registries.. so no, something stupid like you being expelled won't show up. Note however: it can take multiple *years* to get citizenship + passport through the embassies if your unlucky.  A year probably at least if everything goes smoothly. Especially if you're talking about eastern European states. I'm speaking from experience.|||I don't know about the situation in Trinidad and Tobago, but I'm from Europe, where many countries offer free higher education, or highly subsidized higher education. (My own country falls in the second category, where students pay 2k a year themselves, and the government another 10k a year directly to the university for each student).I think you are missing out on one very big important difference between many countries that offer free higher education and the US: in the US, practically EVERYONE gets to go to college. In Europe, this is not the case. Many countries have streamlined systems in which there are different 'levels' of high school, and only the highest gets you into university. The lower levels get you into more vocational type tertiary education (also free). So if you want to get a university degree, you need to perform really well academically for 6 years at high school to get your highest level high school diploma (while not be 'demoted' to a lower level). There is also very little difference between high school curricula, as usually the government is in control of a large part of the curricula and parts of the formal examinations that get you your diploma. Your argument of 'but in that case everybody would get a higher education diploma, lowering the standard' doesn't hold up. The percentages of people going to university vs. vocational education can be very tightly regulated by tightly regulating the examination standards.|||Are you sure you are not confusing COGFUNC_MENTION and COGFUNC_MENTION? I can see how the tertiary COGFUNC_MENTION function of an TYPE_MENTION can seem very similar to the secondary COGFUNC_MENTION function of an TYPE_MENTION, as they both deal with broad vision based idea synthesizing. For example, I am definitely an TYPE_MENTION and I really don't use any COGFUNC_MENTION to be honest, even though I do have a very strong COGFUNC_MENTION (which I depend on a lot more). I rarely think 'well, this is the way it worked for me in the past when I dealt with problem X, so I'll apply the same tactic to this new problem Y because both problems have similar characteristics A,B and C and maybe tweak my approach a bit considering they don't share characteristic D.' I like many other TYPE_MENTION don't work to solve specific problems anyway like TYPE_MENTION do. An TYPE_MENTION will solve a problem to **reestablish** the currently disturbed status quo to keep the organizational engine running in top efficiency with as little hurt and drama as possible (I respect TYPE_MENTION so much for this), while an TYPE_MENTION will use the problem at hand to force a **new** status quo that's more in line with their greater vision of what they want their organization to be.This is also exactly the difference between COGFUNC_MENTION and COGFUNC_MENTION. An TYPE_MENTION will use COGFUNC_MENTION to take into account all the different possibilities of how a problem can solved and what the consequences will be, and then concentrate those possibilities into a choice that benefits the TYPE_MENTION vision most. An TYPE_MENTION will use COGFUNC_MENTION to check their COGFUNC_MENTION reference model for maybe even bÃ©tter solutions to a problem, even if they have no experience using that approach yet. For an TYPE_MENTION the N-component is the *actual* decision making process, while for an TYPE_MENTION the N-component is more of a support to the COGFUNC_MENTION decision making process.|||Not /u/inagiffy but I agree with him/her, even if it's simply because you'll pick up the language more subconsiously. Source: my own experience. I know 5 languages (a mix of germanic, romance and slavic languages) and am learning a 6th and starting a 7th soon. Learning languages does not stick when rushing it. Learning a language properly is a multiyear commitment.|||This is quite a delicate topic to discuss. I'm somewhat close to a recent Nobel laureate at my university, and frankly, the amount of work he put into his career is insane. He has a wife, who is a homemaker, and I doubt it was an actual possibility for her to work because of their children, because he definitely didn't have the flexibility to take care of them if stuff randomly came up because he was so caught up in his work. To consider that Nobel laureates are in the 60+ years age range, we have to discuss how many potential woman of that age there are who have climbed the ladder all the way up to a prestigious full professorship, but moreover, who had the opportunities in their life to fully *devote* themselves to science and have all the support they possibly could from friends, family, and society to do truly great, revolutionary science which requires nothing less but full dedication. I mean, the current pool of potential laureates would be people who finished their degrees somewhere in the 60s/70s.. frankly, although improving, the world wasn't a pretty place for women back then who pursued such big ambitions. If you have to take 15 years off your career (or at least, not being able to go fully at it) because of a child or something, you can forget about that Nobel prize, because the men who didn't have to give up that time and devotion had 15 more years to do their science compared to the women. Of course they'll achieve more with that amount of additional time and energy.|||I don't crack under pressure either. Sure, there is added stress and nervousness, but I keep together and pull through. I know *very* well however when I pushed myself too hard, and I do pay the price for it, but only afterwards not during. When I went too far, I simply get physically ill and break down *after* finishing the job, the moment I allow myself even a speck of rest.|||Life has been pretty damn amazing the last 2 months or so. I got some of the biggest compliments for my achievements in my life from people I very much respect and look up to, I've somehow been on the radar of several senior/higher up people who have been including me in several meetings/events/etc and I'm guessing they're happy with my work because I it's been a couple of times now, and it looks like because of it the higher ups might be planning to give me a new position, specifically created for me. It's been a roller coaster, and everything happened quite suddenly. I've been doing good work for a long time now, but suddenly all these things are happening in only a matter of weeks. Also, my SO has been struggling with mental health issues the past year, and he has been doing *amazing* the last month or 2. He's so happy lately and doing well. This resolved a lot of stress in our relationship which made me so much happier in general.|||'I should this, I should that..' seriously, instead of thinking about what you *should* do with your life according to your peers, parents, society, media, etc, start figuring out what you *want* to with your life yourself. Everyone I've encountered that has this problem seems to be lacking confidence in their own life plan and life expectations, again your **OWN** plan and expectations. Once that starts falling into place, these feelings will also subside. Because, let's face it, if you average all the expectations that get thrown at you from every source expect your own inner self, you SHOULD be a mastermind who spends all his time not going to lectures, but having fun, drinking, getting laid, traveling, while still keeping up with a near perfect GPA, and somehow also be super healthy, only eating good stuff and being extremely fit, of course, without seemingly having to put any effort into it. Oh, and of course, also a couple of internship, with at least one at a prestigious company like Tesla.Enough already with that bullshit. Be you and do those things that are beneficial to the life YOU envision for yourself.|||Why on earth would people complain. This is Ryanair for fucks sake. You *know* everything is going to cost you and the overall experience will suck. That's why you pay as little as 20 euros for a return flight. Want quality  service? Pay for it and fly with another airline. Ryanair is never the *only* option.|||My amazing boyfriend has stretch marks too, and for me, it doesn't make him one bit less attractive, because it's really just stupid stretch marks. Don't let it ruin your confidence, most women don't care.|||So, KEI week is the 'big' event that introduces all students to the full range of student run associations and all activities and such.. However, the timing is usually a bit off for internationals, and sadly, not all of the - especially larger - associations are as welcoming to internationals. Because of this, ESN also offers an introduction week, geared towards internationals specifically.That being said, things are changing rather quickly, and KEI and ESN are teaming up to make Groningen a more inclusive place as a whole. Also, ESN originally was geared towards more of the short stay internationals, but now that Groningen is getting more and more full time internationals, I don't think its really healthy to kick all internationals over to ESN which, in the end, is a rather excluding organization, instead of including the internationals in the much broader student life of Groningen as a whole.So, yeah, ESN is more geared towards internationals, but I would *strongly* advice any (full time) international student to try and take part in the 'regular' Groningen student life and join the 'regular' acitivities and associations, instead of only attending those specifically geared towards internationals. Many associations are very, *very* open to internationals now a days and would welcome you with open arms.|||It is... because west-european countries have quite a few different types of tertiary education which all counts to that statistic but isn't a university degree per se. For example, if you take the Netherlands, secondary education is split up in three levels, only of which the highest leads to a diploma that allows entry into universities. However, the middle level will allow entry to schools of applied science, which is also counted as *tertiary* education, but is not a university degree.|||If you want to stay on in leadership, you need to make it priority to get your programme imbedded into a graduate school or department or whatever is applicable, instead of being busy running the group and tackling more daily problems.. Your group seems incredibly fragile, and you will not get any feeling of rest and get rid of the stress this is causing as long as you know in the back of your mind all effort will go to waste the moment you quit the project.|||So, yeah, A-level secondary education is mandatory for entrance into universities.. But, with GCSE's you might be able (not sure) to get into a University of Applied Science. Maybe something to look into?|||Dutchie who has the top comment replying again: if you simply want tuition at a lower price point than US tuition fees, I again like to recommend my home uni. English speakers like you are in a tough spot, because to apply for UK uni's you need EU residency to get lower tuition fees, not just nationality like the mainland uni's. But the mainland uni's usually dont offer English taught bachelors, usually it's just the masters. My uni, the University of Groningen is one of the very few who offer engineering *and* fundamental sciences in combination with most bachelor degrees being in English (including an English med school like I said earlier). Tuition for EU nationals is 2k a year and it's a top 100 university world wide across the board of the various ranking agencies.In general, admission is based on either having a bunch of relevant AP classes in your desires field of studies or some college experience.|||A whatever-menist *does* mean you support equality, but a specific kind of equality. See this [image](http://jwilson.coe.uga.edu/EMAT6680Fa11/Sabo/As7/circle1.gif). Think of egalitarism as the bigger circle encompassing full equality and the smaller circle of feminism. You can imagine another circle for.. MRA for example which would have some overlap with the feminism circle and will fall completely within the egalitarism circle. You can also image another circle for racial equality which would also fall within the egalitarism circle but not have any overlap with the feminism circle. Any smaller circle support equality, but a specific *subset* of overall equality. That's why I said: an egalitarian is by definition also a feminist, because the full feminist gender equality subset falls within the larger egalitarian subset. However, if you are a feminist you may not feel anything for racial equality, because it's two totally different subsets. Doesn't mean you don't support equality at all, it simply means you support a *specific kind* of equality.|||Yup. But it's key to realize that for many other types, this is the way how they socialize, bond and build loyalty. It might actually be worth it to change your mask and just play along if these are people you'd benefit from if you can develop a better relationship with them.|||I'm super straight, but my father did the same with me. Every time he mentioned possible romantic relations I could/would have, he would *always* say 'boyfriend *or* girlfriend', this went on way into my teenage years, even after I told my dad after I was straight. He later told me he did so because he wanted to make sure I felt safe coming out to him if I would be gay, *and* because he thought it was important to raise me with the idea that it's totally *normal* for a man to love another man, or a woman to love another woman. That both being gay and straight were equally normal and that their love was equally true and real. I'm now in my 20s and really appreciated how my father handled this, as even though I'm straight, this approach made me feel very secure about my own sexuality and be empathetic towards people with different types of sexuality, such as my SO, who is openly bisexual.|||Also Dutch and although I need most of my loans for living expenses, I also bank the rest in index funds. HOWEVER, it is now 35 years of repayment.. but you will most likely pay less per month than under the old rules of 25 years. It's a maximum of 4% of your income that exceeds minimum income. I'm an engineer and will be looking for about 3k starting salaries. At those incomes, it's about 150 euros a month in repayment. Anything that isn't repaid in those 35 years will be paid for by the government. This is relevant in my case, cause I don't get anything from my parents (but also don't get additional scholarships due to technicalities) so I'm looking at 60-70k in loans total.. which I might not have to repay in full do to these pay back rules.Anyway. You should note that your loan will count against your future mortgage. For me that's not a problem, as I don't want to buy real estate.. but especially in terms of getting a first home (starterswoning) it could get tough.|||I'm in the same situation but at the 4 year mark, my SO and I (around OP's ages) decided to open a joint account. I was the one who had to continuously keep ledgers of who paid what and in the end of the month, calculate who owed whom money. It was *so* tiring and useless I got fed up with it. My SO was also uncomfortable at first about a joint account, but after a lot of talking, he agreed. We opened an additional joint account, next to our own accounts. Every month we deposit a specific budgeted amount from our own accounts into the joint accounts from which we pay bills and buy groceries. We had the bank disable being in the red on our account, so in the case of a breakup, there is very limited risk in terms of draining the account by the other person. I'm quite happy with this setup, it saves *a lot* of time and hassle and money talk in general. We are planning on keeping our separate accounts after marriage as well, but pool our income in the joint account and then take out a certain amount of money from our joint to each individual account for discretionary spending.|||Just a random reaction to your post, based on my personal experiences. I am in a committee to select this years 'best' and 'most excellent' student at our faculty. I just got about 50 nomination with their letters/resumes/transcripts to judge. Each one of these 50 nominees is really impressive on his/her own, yet somehow I needed to filter out the best from the best. So, after reading through everything, I took a moment to determine for myself what I consider to be indicators of 'excellence'. I did, and made my selection of students to discuss with the rest of the committee. Anyway, after doing so, I came to a conclusion: 'Shit, I really need to put in more effort to get higher grades when I start my master programmes next year', because, so I realized, doing so would put me in my self declared definition of 'absolute excellence'. But I also decided that I would never apply for this stupid price, because I disagree with its existence to begin with.Anyway, just a fun anecdote that just happened, but definitely fits your view of TYPE_MENTION vs TYPE_MENTION. Also, on your second note, I recognized the behaviour your trying to describe *immediately*. See, on any thing I dare say out loud, I have considered every possible point of view I could find, argued with myself from all possible perspectives, and finally, came to a final conclusion of what it is I think of a certain topic. Once I come to that conclusion I operate under the ultimate assumption: 'I am right until proven otherwise'. So, when somebody challenges my view, I throw every possible counter argument at them, to see how their alternative view holds up to all issues I already considered. Just like I play the ultimate devils advocate with myself, I do the same with others. If you made a good argument, I will go back to my mental drawing board, and again go through the whole process of analyzing my ideas and evaluating them from all perspectives, taking into account the new info you provided me during the discussion. If I indeed come to the conclusion that you have provided me with solid arguments that hold up in my mental gauntlet, I adjust my own opinions accordingly. I learned to actually go back to people who changed my view, and thank them for it, but I can see why most TYPE_MENTION wouldn't and just carry on as if nothing happened with their new point of view, because simply put, the process has been done, case is closed, view is set. Repeat ad infinitum. It's not really 'not caring about how you feel', it's simply going through the hyper rational process of analyzing an argument and seeing where the argument fails. Ok, nevermind, this is kind of the definition of 'nor caring about how you feel' as, yeah, when I'm going through this process, it's pure rational and I indeed don't care. BUT, that also means that when I'm being the ultimate bitch devils advocate, I definitely don't do it to make you feel bad about yourself or your ideas, I simply do it for the sake of the argument.|||Just throwing it out there, as I also thought I was an TYPE_MENTION at your age, but turned out to be an TYPE_MENTION once I developed my functions a bit more during my time at university: don't disregard the hormone rage. Hormones suck, and being a teenager, there is simply no way around the influence hormones will have on your feelings and decision making. Don't be too hard on yourself.|||Ok, I'm really loving this [top](https://topvintage.nl/nl/vintage-retro/50s-hanako-crepe-blouse-in-black).

I want to love it, but not convinced about whether I can pull it off. Anyone any inspiration or ideas?|||You do realize the original was posted by the child in /r/funny right?|||Patriarchy hurts men just as much as it hurts women. Other commenters have already provided a lot of examples of sexism towards men in our society. Extremist feminist do not fight for equal rights, because they refuse to acknowledge sexism towards men. By doing so, in time we will trade in the patriarchy for a matriarchy in stead of a equalist society, and it is my oppinion (as a woman) that this in time will hurt women just as much as the patriarchy hurts men. That's why I do not identify as a feminist, but egalitarian, because I belief equality for women will be the result of also achieving equality for men.|||Being vegan makes it tougher, but honesty I honestly do not get the hate on this food budget. I've lived vegetarian for a couple of months as well when money was tight and this number did just fine. Like I said, 5kg couscous for 8 euros and rice for even less. Also, get onions as a staple, 5kg of basic red onions is only 2.50 or something. Get 1 whole bread for 1 euro, that'd about 10 sandwiches there already. Get B-brand peanut butter, jam and chocolate paste for 1 - 1.50 euros per jar with easily enough for 15 sandwich servings per jar. Get to your local street market and you can get multiple kilos of veggies and fruit for a couple of euros. Beans are cheap, not even 1 euro per can, milk is also cheap. The only thing that made the budget stretch itself was buying cheese to replace meat with, but especially in our cheese country, at least cheese is *relatively* cheap. What I would eat on a single day:2 sandwiches for breakfast and 2 for lunch. 2 bananas or apples a day as a snack. Rice/couscous/potatoes/pasta with 500 grams of veggies and some beans (half a can) or something similar like feta or other cheese for dinner. Drink tap water during the day. This honestly does not add up to more than 3-3.50 euros a day. Which is exactly that 100 euros a month I'm talking about.Actually this is exactly what I still eat every day, but now I have some more room in my food budget and I take out the extra beans or their alternative and get meat instead. 1 portion of meat for dinner and some meat stuff for sandwiches easily costs about a euro extra. Plus I drink lemonade instead of tap water, so that's a bit more expensive as well. That gets you to about 5 euros a day, which cranks up the budget to 150 a month.|||And here you probably have the biggest reason to not quit. The reasons you list why you fear finishing your PhD will not go away of you quit now. You'll still have to - in your own line of reasoning - compensate for multiple years not spend at the career of your choice, you will still be overqualified even without the title. So quitting now won't solve those issues, but *will* leave you with nothing to show for it. That's why you need to stay. Quitting now provides no benefit while not quitting might provide benefit either in your next career step or later on in your career.|||I meant safe as in an environment where a girl would not face judgement or ugly looks if she expresses an interest in cars or engineering or whatever. Like it or not, when a girl says she want to play with cars and build her own racecar a lot of people will still push a doll in her face and tell her cars are not something girls should play with. Maybe safe isn't the right word, a 'judgement free space' explains my sentiment better.|||I agree! I am very much a quality time person, so if a friend would tell me they'd take me out to see a movie together and they'll take responsibility to plan the whole thing, that would be amazing. I just really like spending time with people I love and care for. But below, you'll already find a lot of other responses regarding physical gifts and what not.|||So, the TU Delft (Technical University Delft) in the Netherlands has a track programme called 'Nuclear Science and Engineering' that can be followed as part of a masters degree in either Chemical Engineering or Applied Physics. Their masters are in English. However, you'd have to get your bachelors degree first and the TU Delft teaches their bachelor degrees in Dutch. What you could do however, is do your bachelor in either Chemical Engineering or Applied Physics at the University of Groningen (my university) which is currently the only Dutch uni to offer all bachelor STEM degrees in English. Both CE and AP are offered by the University of Groningen. With your bachelor diploma in your pocket, you can transfer over to do a masters degree in Delft without a problem. A bachelors degree takes 3 years, a masters degree 2 years. If you want to *stay* in the Netherlands/Europe, you need to get a master, as employees don't really consider a lone bachelors degree to be a starters qualification. Tuition fees for non EU students in the Netherlands are quite high however, about 10k a year at the Uni of Groningen. I study Chemical Engineering at the Uni of Groningen by the way. If you have any specific question, do PM me, I'll help out where I can.|||Yeah, I figured OP might be a UK resident considering the MSc in the UK.|||But at least there is this whole world in which you explore why the fuck you woke up in a clinic getting blood shots and stuff. You slowly learn about who and what your char is actually about. The story imo has a lot more depth and sense compared to DS.|||Emphasis because this is what your whole reply boils down to and I think this is what OP is not understanding. Like OP said in a previous reply: you don't know what it is like to *not* have money, just like you don't understand what it means to built op your own wealth, privilege and easy life.If your parents honestly perceive your GF's behaviour as classless, it is just not you who it will reflect on, but the whole family who worked so hard to get to this 1% position in life. Whether you agree or not that they *should* value these things is beside the point, because clearly they do and that is not going to change.|||I agree, professional programming skills will get you a job anywhere, however, OP is not doing CS but biotech..  I don't have biotech degree, however, my faculty does and there are plenty of jobs, especially if you are not bound to a specific city. The thing is that in the current educational culture in (western) Europe bachelors degrees aren't valued a lot and and are considered 'incomplete' without a masters degree. This even holds true for CS, because those jobs at bachelor level are usually jobs at start ups etc which you get in through your network. The larger, traditional companies are very unlikely to hire people with just a bachelor degree.That being said: the moment you have a STEM masters degree, there are *a lot* of jobs to be found, many in engineering, but less in life sciences (biology etc).|||Organisational structures will be different across universities of course, but for this example, I'll take my own uni to explain.Our faculty (headed by the dean) consists of several research institutes, which each have their own director. Within each institutes there are research groups, headed by full professors who will have several assistant and associate professors under his or her wing. I think, in this case (depending if your own prof is full prof or not) you can get either the full prof of OPs research unit or the director (if OPs prof is a full prof) involved AND also the dean, but both need to be approached from a different perspective.The director for example is responsible for the wrongdoings of the people in their institute, the director can be approached from a goodwill perspective. 'I have in many ways been treated unfairly and unjustly by the professor *you* appointed and your previous measures did not proof helpful at all, you owe me to set this straight, especially because my academic record is beyond excellent'.The dean can be approach from an HR perspective, as HR is bound the the faculty as a whole and reports directly to the faculty board. 'Way happened is in no way legal and HR failed to solve the issue when it was presented earlier, now my career is on the line and I will not take this lightly, we need to find a solution and I suggest the faculty is to support me in finding another position at another university.'The dean in this case is really valuable to have on your side, because they both can act on your behalf in approaching their own network themself *and* by pressuring the director/full prof in aiding you.(Of course, it should be brought up a bit more tactfully then what I just wrote down..)Also: if there are any profs from other groups who are sympathetic to what happened to you (as it seems from OPs post), they might really be willing to help you find a place elsewhere, even if they don't want you in their own group because of the politics among the colleagues. In the end, you just really need to be bold and actually approach this like a typical man would approach this: straightforward without regard of social hierarchy and claim what you need without ever backing down. Woman really suck at this in general because we are so sensitive to social cohesion and such.|||NO. I have an amazing SO, now 4 years going strong. He's TYPE_MENTION, highly educated like myself, *childfree* like myself, and frankly, when I told him even before we started our relationship that being with me would require leaving your life behind every couple of years to travel and live in new countries and put my career first, before your own.. He said: 'That sounds absolutely amazing'. We're both finishing up our studies and planning on living abroad and he still shows absolutely no signs of backing down on his promise that he'll follow me to where-ever. When you'd ask him why he fell for me, he would actually even answer that it was because om my strong personality, because he likes strong, intelligent women. But compromises always need to be made, and in this case, it means that my SO isn't very ambitious when it comes to his career or really in general. He simply enjoys life day by day, just cooking and exercising and reading books for nothing else but the sake of learning new things. He is open to personal reflection and development though, which is a deal breaker for me if he wouldn't be. I told him outright: \\\"I love you and want to spend my life with you, but I'll leave you the moment you stop working on yourself yourself. I don't care if (he has had major depression, currently it's flaring up again) it's a little tiny step every time, I don't care if you fall back from time to time, but you need to be committed to improving yourself and our relationship, if not, I'm out.\\\"I didn't know I could, but I honestly love the damn man more every day I spend with him. And when I think my heart can't possible hold anymore love, I come home to flowers he randomly bought \\\"because he loves me\\\", and my heart would just burst. I will say this though: having a relationship is REALLY hard. It requires both people to give more than they take, every single day. It requires you to put the other first, every single day. It requires to forgive, it requires you to be patient, it requires you to put your feelings aside from time to time, because your SO is in a bad place and needs all of you right now, it requires you to love and have faith through moments you'd rather just walk away and shut the door behind you forever. It's *really* not easy.. and especially for an TYPE_MENTION woman.. you might want to consider not having a long term relationship in your life. I'd understand that decision to be honest.. It's difficult enough as it is.If you'd like my advice by the way: from your post, you sound very aggressive... If you'd want to attract someone like my guy, who is a lot more introverted and gentle, the aggressiveness is really off putting. Even for a fellow male TYPE_MENTION, the aggressiveness might be very off putting. In the end, you want to come how to a pillow after a stressful day, not a punching bag.|||Thanks, I'll have a look! Not a problem that there isn't an English version, my Serbian is at B1/B2 level, so that's not an issue.|||Just letting you know I did/do the same! There wqs a thread earlier about this on this sub as well which had many people chiming in, maybe look it up through the search engine. Conclusion: you're not weird and not the only one.|||Can you tell me more about the stroke order add on?|||Oh my. This thread is amazing. This also really shows why so many other redditors dislike our sub, because of our 'antisocial' behaviour. If you put NT communication vs. typical SF communication it kind of makes sense they simply don't *get* it|||Your comment hits home quite hard. But the thing is, I reacted that way to my mum because of who I am, if I were another type, I probably would have dealt with her way differently.|||Is this also the case when the father is actually recognized on the birth papers?|||Hahahaha. Yeah. No. We might have personalities that definitely favour us when it comes to which traits are valued in a business setting, but when it comes to romantic / interpersonal relationships.. yeah. Nah. We definitely do not have an innate ability to thrive in those without having developed the capability to apply thorough self reflection and definitely some humility. We might be attractive when first impressions still count, but there is a lot of ugliness under the surface which comes out quite quickly after first impressions don't cut it anymore. I still sometimes wonder how on earth my partner is still sticking around with me after 5 years, as I'm definitely not an easy person to share a life with.|||Can't you explain to the coach and ask him if he'd cover for you? Maybe you can make up a white lie about having to 'practise' on thursday afternoon (or whatever other day) and instead you stay at achool during those hours to study?|||As an TYPE_MENTION woman I'm always really grateful to see a man acknowledging this. It's honestly very hard to be your typical TYPE_MENTION self and do that what you love and makes you happy, *knowing* you as a woman will be very much disliked (and sometimes even hated) for it. Ambitious women among themselves know these struggles, but having a few men in your social circle who are also understanding really helps a lot to keep you going despite the societal backlash. It's men like you who once they reach management will provide good workplaces where women will not be discriminated against. It's men like you who will make sure women will in time be treated equally and not be disliked simply because they are ambitious. Thank you.|||Did you guys discuss your anniversary beforehand at all? Did both of you agree on the same expectations of the day? And I mean, did you explicitly discuss gifts, activities and dollar amount, not just 'maybe we should do *something* for our anniversary'.Yes, you are absolutely justified in feeling hurt, but from your post I really got the feeling there was a lack of communication between you two as a couple about expectations. Same now, because your answer sounded like 'oh no worries, yeah something would be nice, but it is not a really that big of a problem' to me, but in your mind, it actually is a big deal.If the issue is communication, you can't just blame *her*, but should blame both of you equally and then work to improve on your communication skills as a couple.|||I want to try to explain your mums train of thought. You say you like the logical way of reasoning and that's why you can't reconcile what your mum says and what other sources tell you. As a logics fan you must be familiar with the concept of logic always beihg deducted from certain premises. One of your premises however is false, namely that all humans reason and act logically. It is a highly emotional decision to have children for non spectrum people. Although being on the spectrum doesn't make you bad or broken or any less worth,  but it does make you different than the norm. Most parents wish for their child to fit the norm because of societal values. If a child does not fit the norm like you do most parents accept this after a while and reconsider their thoughts about, and dreams and wishes for their child. Some however like your mum have difficulty letting go of the idea of having a child that fits the norm. Now on to the false permise. A logical person would just say: hey, shit happens, because stastical chance. However, this does not provide any help in getting to term with the situation. Non spectrum people often feel the need to focus their energy on outside sources to make sense of their feelings and have something to hold on to. This may or may not be a logical source. In the case of your mum it was the anti-vaxx movement which gave an explaination of why you are not developing according to the norm and gives her something and someone to blame. This helps her in making her FEEL better, which is that important to her to the point that she's forsaking logic.So: reconsider your premises on which you ase your logical reasoning and deduct from that what to believe.|||I'm guessing you didn't have a section in your report stating who wrote/was responsible for which part? If so, get your group together and get a copy of your report in which you all three mark which part is written by who, signed at the bottom by all three of you. Hand that copy to your prof and ask him to check which parts are plagiarized and to check who's parts are questionable. You can even do this if the third guy doesn't agree doing this. You and your friend could note the parts you are sure of you had full ownership of and again ask the prof to check it with the parts that are in question.|||Agreed with /u/gnoah0 . Anywhere in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany or France you your average home cooked meal will cost you 3-4 euros. Southern/Eastern Europe will cost even less. Exceptions are of course Switzerland (which is most likely the most expensive European country in practically every category) and some Scandinavian countries.That's not even taking into account the quality of the food: fresh baked bread every day at all supermarkets, a whole bag full of fresh fruit for only a couple of euros at the local market square.|||Is there a specific thing in this city you feel extra excited about? Something equivalent in feeling to for example visiting the Louvre or the Eiffel tower in Paris. I would go for that extra night, also, travelling on your own is a whole different amazing experience as well. But I would also keep those special sights for later, to experience those things that make that city special to me together with my SO. This is also a nice thing to communicate back to him, because I totally get his sad feeling as well: I will go, but I also find it important to share this unique experience with you, so I'll be saving X events/museums/activities for when where here together, so it will still be special.|||Everywhere in the industrialized world feminism fought for the right to have women be able to work the same hours as men for the same pay, equality above all. In the Netherlands feminism fought for the right of women to educate themselves and be able to take on a job while *still* being able to take care of their family and children. That's why feminism in the Netherlands led to more socialist laws, instead of capitalist laws. Currently the demographics are shifting towards men also working more part time to be able to spend more time with their children, often called 'daddy days' where the father goes back from working 5 days a week to 4 and gets a day off to spend with their children while the mother is usually at work.|||I think because our internet standard is quite a bit higher.. I mean.. in the EU paying maybe 50 euros for 60/60 glass fibre and tv is about the norm while 70 bucks at Comcast gets you.. nothing really. So when they are talking about net neutrality over here it's not like we would have much to complain if the parliament ensures high standards for non prioritized traffic. The average European is simply feeling the problem a lot less both in daily use as well as in their pockets, that's what I'm trying to say I guess.|||Same for me. I'm curious... What are your current main conclusions with regard to how your emotions are different compared to others?|||Do you even *want* to travel with you mother, regardless of this specific trip? By the way, the answer when it comes to telling her no is easy: \\\"Mother, you will not be joining me on this trip, this is not up for discussion.\\\" \\\"But...\\\" \\\"No.\\\"Remember: \\\"No.\\\" is a complete sentence and does not need any further elaboration or justification. Time to set some boundaries.|||In my country, it is honestly extremely difficult get hired with just a University BSc, because they'd rather hire someone with a similar degree from a University of Applied Sciences instead, as those people are actually trained to do more practical work and have more experience through mandatory internships. Same issue with other EU countries that have tiered higher education.|||I think they used to do studies on the effect of incomes taxation and capital flight. I think they concluded that even higher taxes will make the Netherlands not competitive enough and top talent will move away to other countries.|||Seriously, I read the other big stories on your thread and all say the same: you need to get out there and simply *do stuff*. Doesn't matter if you fail or in the end decide it's not for you, you need new experiences and meet new people. Feed to COGFUNC_MENTION function with new energy. When I started out doing stuff I told myself that I needed to spend every day as such that when I would lie down in bed that night I would be able to answer de following question with yes: if I were to die tonight in my sleep, did I achieve in getting most out of experiencing life? Experiencing life includes a lot of negative feelings and sad emotions, that's part of it just as much as all the good stuff is, so embrace it and start doing stuff that will make your experience those feelings again. To relate to my story: I am super content with my life at the moment, but it wasn't necessary happy, or easy or without fear and uncertainty on any level (either regarding my courses, my health, my relationship, my family or thinking about my future in general. I have had a lot of stress and outright pain, both physical and emotional, the last couple of years). But you *need* to do new things just to simply continue growing yourself as a person. Even if it hurts.|||Well, of course. The first couple of months after child birth a womans body produces ridiculous amounts of happy hormones, new mothers are literally high on their own biological drugs. It's like their bodies are screaming: I NEED TO LOVE THIS LITTLE CREATURE EVEN IF IT COSTS ME MY OWN LIFE. Not even kidding. Evolutionary this is a quite handy trait. These same hormones are also the reason why mothers tend to forget about the pain of childbirth and the stress caused by new borns, which is absolutely necessary to even be able to keep taking care of your child and not resent the baby.So yeah, I can actually believe when new mothers tell me that you can't compare that kind of love. But is doesn't mean shit, because that kind of love is essentially being forced upon you. If the hormone surge wasn't there, we'd see a lot more neglected children and dead babies.|||I mean, you would find IT related courses at a university as well. For example, my university offers a degree in Computing Science and one in Artificial Intelligence. With both you'll learn how to program of course, but the focus will be different. For example, I could imagine an IT student at a UoAS following courses in stuff like network security, database management or game design, while at a university students might follow courses on machine learning and higher mathematics (advanced calculus and linear algebra).I guess with IT the line on career profiles is muddy, as with programming, there are huge shortages and frankly, programming is a skill for which you don't *necessarily* need a degree. Without a saturated market, there will also not be a very segmented career profile for the different types of educational background. Most companies would simply get whoever is half decent at their job, independent of formal education.|||You do realize the (Greek) Orthodox church has nothing to do with the Vatican and the pope, right?|||Would it be a possibility to let your kids decide whether they want to see their dad at all anymore? For example, at 16, I was so fed up with my mum, I decided to go live full time with my dad. At that point, I honestly wouldn't have shed a tear if my mum would drop dead, that's how bad it was. Living with my dad full time gave me a safe haven to grow up in, which was a lifesaver. A few years later and my mum and I kind of rebuilt our relationship again, because I was able to get a break and start again from scratch on my own terms. If you kids feel forced to visit their dad when they don't want to, they will never feel safe to actually open up to their dad and build a relationship with him.|||TYPE_MENTION without anxiety here. I fuck up a lot as well. The difference is that it doesn't affect me in the ways that it does to someone who has anxiety problems. My (non-TYPE_MENTION) SO has anxiety, and he actually got professional mental healthcare help for it. What they teach you in therapy is not how to fuck up *less*, it's about learning how to deal with all the inevitable fuck ups that will be guaranteed to come along. In the end, everyone's a fuck up, you just don't realize it because non-anxiety people don't show the signs that a person with anxiety would show once a fuck up happens.I guess my main message is: you realize your anxiety is affecting your life, and it has been affecting you for many YEARS already. You should get help to deal with that anxiety. And know that asking for help with this issue is not being a fuck up or undergoing a fuck up. It's a damn difficult choice to make that requires you to be a strong person and you should be proud of yourself once you decide to make that step.|||Note that you'll need to travel together though. Theoretically, if you and your husband show up at a non-Dutch EU border and you don't have an appropriate visa yet, you should get one on the spot if your husband shows a EU marriage certificate. But if you for example need to travel for your work, that won't be possible on that specific visa as you'll be travelling independently without your husband.|||Even if there is a market for an international vet practice, I'm not sure if a vet owner will be so keen on hiring a foreigner if practically all Dutch vets (who have a university degree and will have had *at least* 6 years of formal English language education) will speak English fluently. So either you employ a Dutch vet who can serve the local market Ã¡nd the international community, or you hire the foreign vet who is then stuck to only serving the international community, even if at a certain day or whatever, none of those internationals need help with their pets yet the other vets are fully booked. I'm just saying, I could understand that from a management position, it might not be an easy sell to employ OP over a Dutch person, especially because there isn't a shortage of vets in the Netherlands.. If OP is seriously considering to come to the Netherlands, this would be a serious issue to look into before putting all his/her eggs in the Dutch basket.|||Holy shit this is so awesome. I've been wanting to get a chip like yours myself for ages now (ever since I saw the TEDx video from the Dangerous Things guy), but I can't justify it because I simply don't have the time and resources at the moment to work at chip compatible projects. But, really, beyond compare, this is so cool.|||I know the test, but I still don't think narcissism is TYPE_MENTION typical. If you keep the discussing strictly MBTI related, disorders such as narcissism would stem from inferior functions. For TYPE_MENTION, the inferior function is introverted feeling which has to do with building your own moral compass. The introversion is very inward bound, so and TYPE_MENTION in emotional aspects is much more focussed on his or her self. Narcissism, to me, is something typically associated with an inferior extraverted feeling function, which is focused on how people see you and how you react to people and your surroundings. A deranged, inferior COGFUNC_MENTION can very much quickly derail into narcissism, a derailed COGFUNC_MENTION is not narcissism, more like deep inward depression and existential crisis.|||Relationships can be fixed, however, people cannot. Two years in you have to make a choice: do you see yourself with this girl for the rest of your life or do you not? If not, do both of you a favour and don't waste your time together if you know it isn't going to last. If you do, then you should accept her and her flaws wholeheartedly and love her for who she is.|||I think you should consider the question 'why is getting a specific score of x points important to me?'.I mean, all of us TYPE_MENTION *need* to have goals, but I also believe practically all of us have to go through a process of establishing healthy goals that relate to our own personal values and feelings.For example, if you'd answer that question with 'I want to be a pro player' or 'I want/need to be the best' you really need to evaluate why you feel that way, also simply for the fact that those goals are unrealistic.. and frankly, everytime somebody says that these are their goals, it never truly is. With unhealthy obsessions towards goals like these there *usually* is a hidden layer like 'I have perfectionist tendencies and until I master this I will be disappointed in myself' or 'I need to proof to the world I'm the best or else I'm not good enough'. These are unhealthy attitudes and to improve yourself as a person, you need to address such hidden feelings.An example of a healthy goal related to your story would be 'This game is important to me because it makes me happy and I want to challenge myself in the toughest way possible to get as good as I can get' .. but when you have goals that actually focus on your own values the outcome of points doesn't matter anymore. It only matters whether you can truthfully tell yourself 'damn I really did a good job, I'm happy with my progress'.|||Exactly, like I couldn't be an TYPE_MENTION for the same reason. Just putting it out there, because way too many people still relate I vs E to being shy, talkative, liking to party, like peace and quiet to read books, etc instead of relating I vs E to the way how an individual deals with information processing in their function stack.|||I think you'll be fine. West-European countries have tiered educational systems, meaning unlike the US, only a small percentage goes to college/uni. Most employees don't care particularly about grades, because having a diploma already shows you are in the top x% of the population. Within a country educational quality is also highly regulated by the government, meaning a degree quality from university X in subject Y will be very similar to the degree of university Z in subject Y. Some companies do value grade transcripts, but they are a minority. A good example for western europe would be McKinsey, who demand your *high school* Ã¡nd university transcripts. If your diploma average is 3.8/4 you might very well be just fine. What you could do is already contact a bunch of German uni's you are considering and ask them about their requirements. These differ across unis. Although for foreigners you have to go through admissions, it's still considered necessary in western europe to do a university level masters degree, as a bachelors simply gets you no where. Usually admissions are focused on whether or not you have the right prior education at a sufficient level, not to sort out the best of the best.|||If you think you're lacking in time management skills, nothing is stopping you from developing those. Of you find academics aren't challenging you enough (which was the case for me), you should pick up other projects. In the end, time management is not about chasing deadlines and exams, it's much more about setting your own goals and paths and also priorities and working towards getting all of it done. Nothing is stopping you from doing that. And if you fail at exposing yourself to situations that require you to learn these skills, that's on you, not your mum. And face it, even if your mum would 'sit you down' more often to do homework, you'd still not truly learn these skills, you'd only learn to work when an authority tells you so. No independent goal and priority setting going on in that situation.|||Like lot's of people already said, now you need to follow through and not give in to your mother anymore.. however, what was not explicitly mentioned and is essential to this strategy is that this also means you can't give any items you *don't* care about.Essentially, *every* request to part with something should be met with a firm 'no'. Even if your mum told your aunt she could have your old underwear, you still need to tell your aunt and mum that you will not part with those items.|||Then why is everyone complaining about US dental prices....? The price points I quoted in my post really aren't that high, quite reasonable actually.|||Netherlands actually, already subscribed to r/dutchfire :) Thanks though!|||Just wondering: someone without a Canadian passport leaving Canada through that airport? Where would they get their exit stamp? If you travel on visa, you need to get an exit stamp / documentation of leaving the country on time to save you from any future immigration issues. Maybe you as a Canadian don't have to pass exit customs because Canadian citizens can use another route, but every airport *needs* a border control exit point. Just like every airport has a border control entry point.In my case, I have dual citizenship for an EU and non-EU country. Although I have a EU passport, I wouldn't need one per se. For example, I can use my national ID card instead of my passport to enter and leave my country, while traveling on my second nationality. So no, you don't need to have a valid *passport* in all cases, however, the law states in my EU country that all citizens above 14 years old need to have a valid national ID/drivers license/passport when in the country. The fact that border control isn't waterproof and you never had personal issues with it yourself, does not mean what you are doing is legal. I'm just saying, what's being proposed in that article is incredibly normal for most modern countries.|||Groningen actually offers an English bachelor and intensive language courses to get your proficiency high enough to enter the Dutch taught Master. Loads of internationals over here, especially a lot of Saudi women studying medicine.|||I'm a child of two multilingual parents. Both parents were raised bilingual, and my father learned another two languages growing up. I grew up trilingual as a result, as my parents both had a different set of languages they grew up with. In addition, I live in one of those 'Learn ALL the languages' countries you are describing, so I learned another 3 to various degrees at school. I'm currently trying to learn a totally new language all together.My fluency differs across all of them. The three languages I grew up with are C2/C2/B1(+), while the languages I was taught in school range from A2 to B2+/C1. My goals are to get my newest language to a B2 level, which will take me.. probably 4-5 years or so (Mandarin), and to get the language I was taught at school that's lagging behind at A2 to a B2 level as well (French). If I start getting some formal language education for it after summer, it will probably take 2-2.5 years for me to get to that level.|||I'm giving you my honest opinion here: I don't think *you* are ready for a relationship and that's the main reason this is not working out, and it will not get better. To be in a relationship you need to have some solid ground under your own feet first, you need to be at peace with you, before you can add to your life in the form of another person being part of it. I think you should break it off, go back home and from the safety and stability of your home, find yourself a job and a place to live on your own. Get your own ducks in a row, both financially (living on your own, handling your own finances) and mentally (getting through your own insecurities and communication issues). It's only after that's dealt with you'll be emotionally ready to start a relationship. Your situation right now is not stable and will not work out, there is too much going on to find some solid ground to use as a foundation to build on.|||Definitely go A4. Especially once you get to the larger proofs and larger exercises, I find most of my own mistakes and issues of understanding comes from not having my full proof or exercise on a single sheet, and having to turn pages all the time. I don't care for 'lost' white space, I'd rather have lots of white space but a clear overview instead of crammed lines of math which confuses me.|||You seriously need to reconsider grad school if you want to work in Europe, especially with only a bachelor business, as a masters degree in you field wil be the absolute minimum for starters jobs. Most business masters are also only 1 year + with your EU citizenship, you'll pay the lower tuition fees and you can take a small odd job on the side during that year to pay for your living expenses. Also, investing in that 1 year to get your masters degree will also open up all the support a university can offer in finding your first job, large job markets, internships for credits and in house support in finding jobs + checking CVs etc. Frankly, even with *just* a marketing master degree, you won't be super competitive, unless you have really good grades and experience on the side: some projects, internships, extensive travels etc. Anything to give you the edge on the average 13 a dozen marketing grad.|||I needed surgery for my broken ankle. Everything seemed fine, but a year post op, I still had so much pain. I ended up going to several different doctors until the last one took me seriously. That surgeon still needed several different MRI/CT/Xrays/etc scans to figure out what was wrong. In the end they concluded the ankle needed to be surgically broken again and realigned. So just over a year post op, I had to go in AGAIN. Recovery to be somewhat painfree is set at 1.5 years. This means that in the end, just because of one stupid break which seemed simple enough to set, caused 2.5+ years of daily pain. Imagine if I never found a doctor who would help me, I'd be in pain the rest of my life and no one would take me seriously... the situation the SO of OP is in doesn't surprise me at all.|||Your time is limited during a test, the number of sheets paper you use most often noten. Having to retrace your calculationa for stupid mistakes makes you effectively do questions twice. Writing everything out step by step sure has hell takes less time than checking and rewriting mistakes.|||This is so funny! @OP, I adore the same styles (Dita, Joan) but I feel completely opposite about it. I am rocking the vintage inspired but applied to modern day look right now as I'm in my twenties because if feel the styles *wouldn't* be appropriate anymore once I get older (mid 30s forward). Something about that with age comes a certain expectation of starting to dress just a bit more conservatively especially once progressing on the career ladder.. I feel the vintaged inspired style might be too 'out there' once I get older.If you ever reconsider, I get *a lot* of positive response from people, both from people I actually know as well as men and women who stop me randomly on the street to complement me on my style. Sure, it's not everyone's cup of tea, but I've never felt as if I was totally out of place (of even out of time).|||I needed 4 surgeries (and another 2 to go in the next 6-8 months...) in the past 1.5 years. Male nurses made me happy, as I have always been more confortable in more 'masculine' environments. I really dislike the overall 'oh you poor thing' atmosphere on the hospital ward when there are mostly female nurses. Simply having a few male nurses running around reduced that sentiment which made me simply feel less nervous and ill.|||The thing that annoys other people I imagine is also the fact that for TYPE_MENTION the standard of 'doing a good job' and running an efficient organization is incredibly high. I can imagine many people in the organization might feel everything's absolutely fine, right as the TYPE_MENTION starts walking in and wants to change everything. This is something that probably frustrates many people which make them think it is about power hungriness instead of a true need to impose order, vision and efficiency.|||Doesn't your lab have rules regarding this? At my uni (all departments), women are not allowed to work on labs at all while pregnant.|||I actually hope they don't, because now the political debate is about ideology, which is what we need. As soon as the papers are released the witch hunt will start, people will get condemned and scrutinized (even if innocent, let's never forget shell accounts are *not* illegal per se!) and the government will end the debate with the statement 'those resposible have been punished, end of story'.|||If you don't mind me asking: how is your contact with your siblings? And how was that relationship growing up?|||I have two very loving parents and an especially good relationship with my father. I love my parents a lot, but not like I love my SO. So no.

You know you *can* do it, so just do it! Really, I get what you are saying. I'm doing an engineering degree as well, while not being really interested in engineering. I look at it like this: it's a golden ticket which takes several years to get in an intellectual prison torture room but when you get out, you can use that ticket to get into any field you want *for the rest of your life*! Engineering degree =/= engineering job. Suck it up just a few months more and instead of fantasizing about dropping out, fantasize about how amazing life will be once you're done with your degree and all the options it will give you. JUST DO IT.|||It's amazing to read how happy you between the lines, your post is also a perfect reminder for me why I most definitely do not want children. Instant happiness drain when I imagine myself in your shoes.|||So take it to the next level and do is properly at uni again. Not sure where you are from, but TA jobs are absolutely the best jobs to have as a student as at my uni they pay *a lot* at about 2.5k euros a month after taxes for a full time position. And my uni is also very lenient in giving out hours even if it takes less time IRL to get the best students to apply. Also, teaching looks a lot better on your CV then working behind the register of a grocery store.|||I agree with this, hoping OP will read it. I got my license at 18, my dad and granddad are also riders. I'm 21 now and my boyfriend of 3 years is midtwenties. He has seen me ride and tells me multiple times every year he wants to get his license when he has the funds. Honestly, I'm against it. I am an extremely cautious driver and am not easily phased by other peoples driving behaviour. My boyfriend however gets irritated easily in traffic and at times slightly aggressive if someone else fucks up and the fuck up affected him. This influences his behaviour in traffic negatively. For him to get his license will mean an incredible higher risk compared to more composed drivers, to whom driving already is high risk one way or the other.Like others have said, 120 mph is idiotic riding behaviour. If his attitude hasn't changed I really support you in not wanting him to ride again.|||Not true for the sciences. A bachelor degree could maybe fetch you a job as an lab analyst, however, there is no reason why they would hire a foreigner to do so, especially a foreigner who doesn't speak German... Any other lab jobs/scientific jobs require *at least* a masters degree.|||There are some additional advantages too. Since the change towards loans instead of government grants you can officially claim your loans against your equity (box 3) when filing your taxes, meaning the threshold before you start paying taxes on equity gets higher. Also, (some say this is unethical, but I disagree, as its simply the law,) if you do the calculations on the minimum you're asked to pay back (max. 4% over your income above minimum income, 35 years), you are very likely not the pay back the full sum of the loan, unless you earn *a lot* from the very start of your career. And even if you do have the pay the full principle, you are very unlikely to in the end have paid any of the interest on the loan.|||I'm getting the feeling people here are really misunderstanding your post. You're like me. Never reaching a goal, because the goal is always in the future and goals get readjusted the moment you get closer to reaching an earlier goal. Always going forward, never looking back and fighting to get a bit further towards your goals every single day. To be able to do so, you must consider all possibilities and outcomes, and have a plan for whatever scenario that might happen, which you - based on your post - have done quite thoroughly. Now, just like all other situations, you need to take a deep breath and start going forward to reach your goal of having a live as a happily married woman. The first step to take is to **talk to your man** and if that does not go, you can run your alternative scenarios. Giving up now and walking away means you are abandoning your goal to begin with, probably out of fear to get hurt. People like us don't do that. **You** don't do that.|||Balkans may actually give you an advantage as most of the Balkan countries are in the EU, which means Bologna (even if not properly implemented). This will make admissions a lot easier. Really, just google around and check the websites from different unis in different countries, mail them about admissions requirements and go from there.|||Ze mogen prima roken, maar moeten hun kankerstokjes dan maar 50-100 meter verderop roken. Sorry hoor, maar *JUIST* op een ziekenhuisterrein lijkt me dat gepast. Ik ben zelf ook meerdere keren langdurig opgenomen geweest in het UMCG, je kunt je niet voorstellen hoe fijn het is om even 20 minuten buiten te zitten net die ene dag dat je voldoende kracht en energie hebt daarvoor, zo'n moment kan letterlijk je week tot een goede week maken als patient. Ik heb het persoonlijk als heel vervelend ervaren dat al die mensen voor de deur zaten te roken, waardoor ik vanwege algemene verzwakking niet eens even naar buiten kon omdat ik dusdanig veel last had van de rook. Nee, bezoekers en personeel die zo graag moeten roken kunnen idd gewoon van het terrein af. Patienten die roken en daarmee hun eigen herstel ondermijnen Ã©n niet-rokers hun optimaal herstel ontnemen doordat die patienten er last van hebben, kan ik ook weinig empathie voor opbrengen.|||Whenever this topic comes up I think (as a woman) two things get confused. The right to an abortion is a very different kind of right than the right to not accept parenthood. We all agree that the right to have an abortion falls under the right to bodily autonomy, which is equal for both genders. In my country for example, a trans man can officially be recognized as male without genital surgery. In that sense, a man could be pregnant and have the right to an abortion, just like women.The issue men usually face is being unable to renounce parental rights, and being forced into the obligations of parenthood. But also this is equal to both genders! A mother who births the child, only because the father wanted the kid and after birth is essentially abandoning the kid, will sill be liable for child support and such, just like men who don't want to have to do anything with the kid. The fact that this doesn't happen often (just like trans men not often becoming pregnant) doesn't mean the rights in essence aren't equal between the genders.It makes me sad that whenever this comes up, it's put in the us vs them category, where the main argument is 'but women *can* opt out and we *can't* and that's not fair!'. While, from my perspective, this is comparing apples and oranges and a such a weak argument. I do agree the whole issue surrounding obligatory parental duty is worth discussing and fighting for, but let's do that together, as this concerns the rights of both men *and* women.|||Klopt! Al is dat wel precies het onderwerp waar dit item over gaat. Regering heeft net een extra 500 miljoen vrijgespeeld voor extra handen in de klas om werkdruk te verlagen en groepsgrootte te verkleinen. Super mooi! Maar dat is duidelijk niet voldoende voor de mensen die zijn gaan protesteren, want salaris is een breekpunt.|||The University of Groningen in the Netherlands offers an English taught bachelor degree in Medicine at 2k Euros tuition fees a year. You'll need to get proficient in Dutch to enter the Masters programme, however, language courses are available. It'd tough, but doable. Groningen is also a great city for students.|||What do you mean with 'learning foreign languages'? Most university language degrees are not specifically learning a languages, but are 3-4 year studies on culture and literature within that language. For example, you can study French (or German, or Spanish, or whatever) in the Netherlands, and you'll be learning the language itself of course, but the majority of your degree will be on history and French literature.|||But also people who would measure as obese on BMI would fall into the healthy category when considering their proposed waist to height measurements.|||Ok, I feel like I can say this, because you and I are in the same boat (hyper successful daughter from divorced parents, lot's of drama, dad having a kid from second marriage at way too old an age, gets to deal with the shit that children inevitably bring). Anyway, your situation is objectively worse then mine though, that being said: your dad had this coming. He made his shitty bed, and gets to sleep in his self made stink. That's his problem to deal with though. I think one of the toughest things for me to learn was that I can still love my father *so much* yet be very critical about his life choices. It can go together, but it doesn't mean you can't put blame where blame is due. And in this case, your dad is to blame for his own shitty life.|||I understand what you're saying, however if you read the comment to which I replied you'll see OPs definition was not this and following his definition a lot of other countries would be an option as well.|||'not much more expensive than Germany'. I mean, I get that everybody on this sub knows that German tuition even for internationals is free or very cheap, but many don't realize you need to be able to show a bank account balance of about 10k euros every year to keep a valid visa and on top of that, you'll need to support yourself, which you'll need about the same amount of money for every year (to cover rent, food, insurance, travel to and from home, tuition, books etc etc). Not sure if this is the case for you, but I think in general many people don't realize that Germany is not necessarily cheap and that in fact you *do* need significant savings.|||That will not help you to move to Europe though. Why this is suggested is because study visas are the only 100% reliable and quick visas you can get. Your other options are a sponsored work visa, which is difficult because your prospective employer needs to proof there is no other suitable candidate in the whole of Europe before foreign work visas are approved, so this only open to super specialized fields. The third option is marrying an EU citizen.|||I've gone through the same feelings from about the time I was 17 when I went to live full time with my normal Dad. First it was 50/50 coparenting between nMom and Dad, then 4 days Dad/3 days Mom etc etc.. Until the LC I have now. Every step I took made me feel shitty about not caring for her like 'a daughter should'. Anyway, that feeling went away over time.. but it took just that: time. I took small steps for the past years, declaring a mini period of NC (sometimes just even a day, sometimes multiple weeks) until I got enough rest and peace of mind and contacted her on myown. Every time I did this I started loving her a little less and it became easier and easier not having contact for longer amounts of time. Right now I'm in LC and I'm comfortable with my current situation.|||In my country (Netherlands) this is the norm for university studies. Almost every course ends with a final examination, if you fail the exam, you can do a resit. There are resits for every course, safe for example lab practicals where attendance and working in the lab is the whole point of the course. So, what happens with your grade when you take a resit? This depends, in some cases the highest grade counts, in other cases the last grade. Both grades will still be in the administrative system, however, only the final grade for that specific course will show up on your diploma. In theory, you could redo first year courses during your last year to get a better average, in practice, this simply doesn't happen. There is one caveat however. We have special awards for students who have 8/10 and higher average (cum laude) and 9/10 ander higher average (summa cum laude). At my uni you disqualify for any of these awards the moment you take a resit. I don't think this is a bad system. All students, also those who pass the first exam, get the opportunity to do a resit and improve their grade. In the end, it's what you know that counts, and if you needed a few weeks extra and an extra try, who cares.|||I clicked the link, thinking exactly the same. I fear it will most likely lead to the second though.. I mean, TYPE_MENTION are pretty good at keeping grudges, especially when they have to do with (personal) failures, and let's face it, if the world would be only TYPE_MENTION's, it will be damn hard to compete as the bar set by society will be impossibly high.

I think in a few months you'll actually be happy for the rational 'non-emotional' approach your fiance had while discussion this, she clearly had everything figured out in her head already. This gives you all the time and energy to mourn the loss of your relationship, without having to worry about all the other things like money etc.|||Totally not BuJo related, but wanted to share that seeing your habit tracker made me feel a bit better about my own 'bad habits' which I really should try to minimize (nail biting, cleaning up after myself instead of leaving my cereal bowl standing there after breakfast, drinking enough water, pushing myself to brush my teeth before bed instead of just crashing down all tired and thinking \\\"nevermind\\\"... guilty as charged on all cases.) Somehow, I feel good being confronted with the fact I'm not the only one struggling.|||Forget about teaching English in the Netherlands. Not only do you have a disadvantage over UK people, learning English in high school is mandatory in the Netherlands. This means that everyone of about 50 years and younger speaks English anywhere between pretty OK to near native level. This also means the market for paid English as second language education is practically nonexistent. Also, you wouldn't be allowed to teach in schools, as that actually requires formal academic qualifications.|||For bulk rice and other Asian products: Definitely have a look at the Amazing Oriental at Korreweg.|||I'm definitely not there yet to be able to follow a show like this, but this is a great resource!

I felt pressured to conform, and being an emotional, confused teenager I acted out against it by doing the exact opposite.I'm not in my 20s and I don't dress the part anymore. I will however be forever grateful for that time in my life, because what I got out from it is a firm sense of self and a whole bunch of confidence in who I am and what I want to be. My goth period burned an attitude straight in the core of my character that tells me that I and my feelings matter, and what others might think of me because of it don't. I still very much like the music and I still dress alternatively, but in a way that fits the image of how I want to present myself to the world, which that of a strong, professional, independent young woman.|||Thanks for taking the time to reply, it's really appreciated. Saving your comment for future reference. :)|||I mean this in the best way possible, but have you considered the option those recruiters said it's 'just your GPA' as an easy way out excuse for not hiring you? I've done my share of interviews and sometimes somebody comes around who you don't want because of for example personality reasons.. when you call somebody to tell them they didn't get the job and they ask why, you are not going to answer 'because we all thought you were an arrogant prick who can't be trusted'.. citing GPA instead is an easy excuse in that case. I'm not saying you come across like an arrogant prick, I'm just saying it *might* be possible you keep getting rejected because of something you are not aware of and recruiters don't want to say to you to your face.|||That's easy for me, my country (when they still had active conscription of men) had a whole list of reasons that would be applicable for me that would most probably disqualify me if I were drafted in my 20s - of course, besides being a woman:- I'm a full time student.- I'm an only child to my parentsAnd after I finished my studies, I have two options to not get drafted, depending on what I would choose for my further career:- Having a deemed important and critical job (engineer)- Having or working towards a PhD.|||Oh god, here we go. Been there, I was Alice. Albeit a year of two older. Doesn't matter at which age your parents get separated, as a child you feel kind of lost inside. Even if you don't notice it, the lack of good role models when entering/going through puberty eats at you. So there's Alice, having already faced one failed relationship. Then you introduced her to Lucy and she finally got to experience what it should be like to have a *real* family unit and what a healthy relationship between adults in the family units looks like. Then you broke up with Lucy and Alice had to feel the pain of losing a mother figure and a female role model. And you just reinforced to her that good, healthy relationships are a unicorn and probably won't happen to her. No you introduce her to Candy. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. You already reinforced it in her mind that there is no way you are able to have healthy, long relationships and now you expect her to believe you it will be different this time around and she should just *trust* you on this one and give Candy a chance. The girl doesn't want to be hurt again, damnit!And you, her father.. how do you answer these fears she has? You send her to her room, because you don't like her attitude. You are essentially telling her you don't acknowledge her feelings, worse yet, you are telling her you think her feelings are stupid enough to send her to her room over. And when she *tries* to talk to you about her feelings - albeit screaming and yelling and calling names because frankly teenagers simply don't have the words to talk like adults over emotional topics - you're answer is: you know what? You know that female role model you like because I forced her in your life and *made* her that role model for you? Well, fuck you Alice, you're not allowed to see her anymore because you don't trust me enough that I won't rip this new female role model I just introduced to you from your life once you bonded with her. (*Even though I just did so with the earlier role model*)Don't you see how fucked up your behaviour seems to her?So this is what you do:You tell Candy you love her, but for now, you are going to focus on your child. You have little time with Alice, so make it count. Do all the fun things you can with her. Talk to her. Bond with her. Build trust. Together, which means without Candy (or Lucy for that matter). Candy and Alice will not be in the same room together while she is with you, and father-daughter time will not be limited because you want to see Candy and therefor give priority to your girlfriend over your daughter, remember: she was here first and she *depends* on you. This means you can still see Candy, but for example only when Alice is out with friends. Candy should understand, if she doesn't, she's not stepmother material to begin with. Also, Alice gets to see Lucy. Alice right now feels as if she is trapped in a hostile environment without adults she can trusts. She does not trust you, but she trusts Lucy. Alice needs to feel safe again, and she feels safe with Lucy. Once she'll feel safe again, she will most likely open up more to you again as well. Alice needs to feel loved and wanted by her father. If you don't invest in this *now* you will have a very tough time during her teenage years which lots of resentment that will follow her into adulthood.|||... I'm honestly simply speechless.

This also means that foreign students participate in internships on *student* visas. Most EU countries don't really have something like internship visas so determining which visas you'll need will be a hassle for you *and* the company. Also, in western Europe (don't know about other regions), academic level internships usually last at least 3 months, up to 6.

Note that most uni's require you to apply rather soon, for Dutch nationals it's before the 1st of May, maybe it's even earlier for internationals depending on the uni. As soon as you're here on a study visa, you can always drop by your city hall to get your answers on the more detailed questions. They usually have general hours where people from IND are present, or you can make an appointment. Maybe you can even drop by when you visit your SO next time before you get here on a student visa, or give this list of questions to your Dutch SO and have him/her drop by city hall.|||Consider answering yourself why you are writing this blog. To me it seems you're writing this as some sort of inspiration to other foreign students with an interest in studying in Germany. Of that's the case, your blog will not lose value and credibility of you simply write it from your personal TUM perspective. You don't need to claim an authority position about studying in Germany from a nation wide view point. If you want to write your blog as a sort of anthropological study of cultural differences, you need to change your perspectives and might make it less useful for prospective students. For example, I saw how you commented on somebody else who also made this point that you feel  the TUM doesn't give a lot about what's best for stusents, but just fits lecturing hours to the profs schedule. If you want to take the anthropological route, don't talk about that specific issue, but talk about how in Germany it's the standard that graduate (and usually also undergrad) courses are exclusively taught by professors who are appointed as researchers first and teachers second. Most profs don't teach more than 30% of the time by contract, the other 70% goes towards research. This gives a whole different dynamic compared to for example a typical CC in America. Talk about how that dynamic influences the type and quality of education.|||As a European, I think you Americans are all fucking mad. That being said, I also think Trump won't be as bad as his election persona makes him out to be, the man is not an idiot.

Somewhere around there would be a nice point to end your brow line.|||(I haven't watched your link by the way, but did read your other comments.)It is an interesting claim. I think, and you already started commenting a bit on this in your other reply, an important starting point question is to what extant certain 'preferences' are biological or societal/historical. This question is especially important considering the immensely large culture gap between the 50s and the 21st century. Women are no longer required to stay at home to take care of the children, because we now for example have proper birth control, which makes having children an option, not a given. This alone changes the whole premise you noted in your other comment regarding the necessity of traditional gender roles. There are a lot of similar, but maybe less extreme and obvious out there as well which influenced society as a whole. If the traditional gender roles were indeed the biological preference of women, then yes, the statement of Mansfield rings quite true and feminism (especially at that time, not necessarily talking about modern feminism) quite missed their point. However, I don't think that the case. I think men and women are a lot closer in preference to each other than we assume, based on historical / societal settings and gender roles, especially compared to the 50s.I do believe - and science says so as well - there are *some* biological differences, where on average, boys (at a *very* young age already) show more interest in object-orientated toys/professions etc, while girls show more interest in social-orientated toys/professions. This shows a biological preference, but **not** a biological imperative. For me this means, if all were free, unbound by traditional gender roles and pressure, to choose what held their interest, there would still be more girls choosing nursing and still more boys choosing car mechanics. This will never be 50/50 due to biological preference. However, we would still see a lot more female mechanics and male nurses then we do right now. What I'm saying is this: I think the premise that the 50s societal situation should be taken as a standard to judge the biological preference of women and men with regard to their ambitions is a wrong one to begin. I'm also saying men and women aren't (biological) equal, but I am saying that the situation in the 50s was far off from the biological preferences of the genders, and feminism *has* helped to change society which allows for these preferences to show more than they did back then. Then, onto the statement on Marxism inspired feminist leaders: I think Mansfield is stepping into the discussion too late, while disregarding the effect of the world wars on the work force situation. Feminism started a lot earlier, around the turn of the 20th century.. and it's butt got kicked into overdrive when indeed capitalist needs made women join the work force following the first world war, considering the simple lack of men at that time. I think women joining the traditional work force and feminism are two separate processes which intertwined as women settled into the work force permanently after which feminism picked up and ran with the social inequality at the workplace for women.|||The Netherlands and Germany have strongly tiered systems starting early at the beginning of high school. Typically you have vocational school levels which prepares students for jobs like carpenting or plumbing, a middle level for jobs like physical therapy and nursing and a level which is explicitely geared towards entering university. In general you'll need a diploma from a *gymnasium* level school to enter university. Many other countries have tiered systems as well, the scandinavian countries in general have a 'two phase' high school in which the first few years are general and compulsary for everyone and you do the last few years at a specific level needed to enter universities. A bit like GCSE vs A-levels in de UK, which is another example or EU tiered systems.The closest you'll find in the US are either private prep schools or AP classes. Talking about AP classes, this is also exactly the reason why entry requirements for US students who want to enroll at EU university bachelor programmes often demand a certain number of AP classes on your high school diploma.If you're interested, wiki has incredible entries on various education systems across europe.

After the cast is gone it'll be another 2 weeks until a second surgery which will remove some screws that were put through both fib and tib to get the torn ligaments to grow back which caused dislocation of my tib. Those screws cannot do any weight bearing or else they'll break, so yeah, the real PT work will have to wait untill mid/end of febuary. However, I will start with PT as soon as the cast is gone to get some basic muscle strength back which I lost during that time. I've done my research on these kind of injuries, the recommended treatment of my surgeon is completely in line with (international) standards.|||No, I agree the sister *should* be cutoff. But there is a difference in simply not engaging with the sister anymore and refusing to see her, and for example refusing to talk to the parents about the sister or hearing stories about the sister through the parents. OP should tell her parents: \\\"Sister has violated my trust beyond compare, I'm choosing not to engage with her for an indefinite amount of time\\\" and leave it at that, but still communicate openly about her sister *with* her parents and acknowledge the relationship between her parents and her sister. Take the moral high ground so to say, choose not the engage, but don't be aggressive about the topic to others in the family, all for the sake of keeping the peace to keep her husband safe.|||Saving this to listen to at a later time. I am super interested in the VivoKey, can't wait to get my hands on it. I already made a deal with my uni to mirror all my security keys to the VivoKey, so I can access door access, coffee machines, printers and all other card accessed stuff with my implanted chip instead.|||It sucks, recovery is about a year and I already had 1 year ripped from my life because of this shit and now I'm facing another. But still, the only thing to do is to keep looking a head and take it one step at the time. (well.. maybe not steps in this case as I'll be wheelchair bound again. :P)On the more positive side of things: I'll just ask my mum to come in and do all the cleaning in my house. That way she'll feel special for being needed and my partner doesn't need to do all the housework while taking care of me on top of everything.|||Yeah, the drive was fine... However, I tried to fsck the HD from my Live USB drive after I did the smartctl scan and my HD decided it refused to boot at all. Did a clean install, let's see how long it takes until problems start showing up again.|||I'm not the one to call for divorce quickly, seeing I'm a child from a divorced family myself and seen how awful it is. However, I have read through the whole thread and saw OP saying the following things:1. He's has seen his wife go through many manic episodes and based on past behaviour he is afraid that the mother might take off and take the younger children to 'life under a bridge or something'.2. The children have not been to school since the mother left.3. The oldest son found their mother in an attempted suicide and had to take action to prevent her death. Even after this the women showed suicidal tendencies. Because of all this, the oldest apparently needs therapy to cope.I don't care how much you love your wife and want to help her, the moment you had children your children and their well being come first. Whether or not OP is a saint, this woman is not a safe person to have around the children. As their parent your childrens safety is your priority, that's why I'm saying I don't understand he's not divorced and is willingly allowing the children to be in the (unsupervised) presence of this woman.|||Well.. that's totally fucked up legislation to begin with in that case which needs adjusting simply based on the fact that being a recognized father you have certain rights, which includes not having the kid suddenly given to a safe haven without your consent.|||There's a vegan supermarket halfway through the Nieuwe Ebbingestraat if I remember correctly.|||I'm expecting the Islamophobia to become worse in many places. Maybe in the US because of the presidential campaigns, but Europe as well because of the migrant issues. It's the whole attitude of west vs east again. In that regard it won't matter where your kids will grow up, they'll have to face these issues in our globalized society of today. Even if you stay in Islamic countries while your kids are growing up you'll need to monitor them and guide them to make sure they don't stray from the right path towards radicalization.That being said, the west can use some incredibly thoughtful and caring muslims in their societies. I am an atheist myself, but agree with you that many of the teachings of the Quran would benefit a lot of people in becoming better persons, not just muslims. Also something to consider, although this lies outside of your concerns of your family, but may speak to you in the greater scheme of things: you and your children showing the love Islam can bring, opposed to the hate people in the west are getting accustomed to, may very well be a reason why some white kids won't radicalize on the other side of the spectrum.|||My boyfriend goes to de Zwarte Raaf (Folkingestraat) for his beard, which is a real men only barber shop, no girlfriends, mothers or sisters allowed. He always looks great, the (senior) barbers are really good. I think he pays 16 euror something for a beard cut.I myself (female) go to Capelli in Steenstilstraat, which is a more traditional hair salon, but with really professional people who know what they are doing. The owner is a man and they also have a lot of men as customers there. It is a bit more expensive than most hair salons at 25 euros or something, but they're great, for me it's worth it.|||The highest high school level is either the normal variant or the 'gymnasium' variant. If you want to do gymnasium, you need to do one of the classics.. if students aren't interested in those, they simply have to attend a non-gymnasium school of the same level. Some students have issues with it, for example those who have zero interest and ability for language, but are amazing at maths. But in like I said in another comment, for us as a tiny export country, knowing languages is important not on an individual level, but on a societal level.|||Yes, that actually makes me feel even more sure your degree would be comparable to a Hochschule degree from Germany. Not sure whether it qualifies based on educational background alone, but then again, IT is very much a wanted field, so that's a plus!|||Other commenters already pointed out some majors things: if she is a EU citizen, by law, she *needs* to travel on her EU passport. Getting her visa on het US passport would be fraud.So the question is: did you husband register here at a French embassy, meaning, is she officially recognized as a French citizen? If your husband never officially registered her, you can legally get her a visa on her US passport, but considering you're already waiting on the passport to arrive, I'm guessing that's not the case.What happens if a 'grown up' EU citizen is abroad and would need to travel on short notice and for example their passport was stolen, they can go to an embassy and the embassy is able to issue a short term 'emergency' passport. Maybe your husband can call the French embassy and ask whether similar options are available for her as an underaged child.Follow-up question: are you legally married? In the EU, once you are married, you can add your spouse's last name in your EU passport, next to your own. Not sure if thats the case for US passports as well. I'm asking, because next to visas you also need to figure out which documents your SO needs to sign to 'allow' you to travel with your kid alone. EU border control is really strict on checking this due to child kidnap cases. Having the last name of the kid (assuming kid has the father's last name) will make border control a lot easier, but get the necessary documentation anyway.|||If you want kids in your life, I truly hope your future daughter turns out to become a strong and rational female engineer in management. Just as I hope your future son turns out the most compassionate and kind male nurse. Yes, todays education system systematically hurts boys, personally, I think this is one of the biggest concerns of our generation: the way how feminism is now slowly turning society in one that highly favours women, at the cost of men. That however does **not** mean all is fair and well for girls right now. Only when we recognize sexism toward **both** males and females can we work towards a true egalitarian society, this post simply just happens brings to light some issues regarding sexism towards girls.

Why not work a job in the Netherlands for 6 months, maybe waiting tables or working at a bar or something, and go backpacking through Europe with that money for another 6 months?|||Good points, will keep this in mind!|||Fair enough, hope you got to resolve whatever issues there were and you are happier now.|||Will you be able to PM me some contact info for someone involved with the project at your school? I'd love to hear some best practices. About recruitment: I got HR to give me a list of all academic staff members that fit the age criteria and approached each of them individually. All were enthusiatic about the idea and only one opted out, because she was a month away from labour and would take her maternity leave soon. The support has been amazing, bit on the demand side, I'm guessing yes, groups will need to be formed.|||No, not in my community. The Dutch student community is very much based on personal development. Practically nobody is 'just studying'. People get involved with politics, teaching, student societies and communities, or start their own business. On top of simply being involved, a lot of students spend one or more years being on a board of an (often fully student run) organization.. I actually notice that in my direct community, which is the STEM community, female students are often *over represented* in position of leadership like these boards and similar functions, relative the the percentage of female students studying STEM.|||I believe in any relationship (with parents, friends, lovers) you can never expect anyone to change for you, except for yourself. If your SO wants to change, she should do it for *her* based on her thoughts and feelings, not to appease you.So, that leaves the following: you find yourself at a cross roads and someone needs to change to be able to continue the journey together. Considering you can't expect your SO to change to suit you, the only question left is whether you are willing to change.I was in the same position as you were. I simply figured having kids is what I'm supposed to do. Through a lot of talking with my SO and thinking I came to the conclusion I was wrong and having children isn't what would make me happy, having a childfree relationship with my SO would. So I changed my mind and became childfree.|||When it comes to Europe, you should give up on the idea to learn 'utility languages'. The thing is, Europe knows far more languages than it even has countries, as many countries have local language as wel, such as Catalan or Flemish. For example, I'm Dutch and there are still *a lot* of kids who grow up with Flemish only and learn Dutch as their *second language* once they start with school.I think you have two options:Try to find yourself 'expat friendly' job openings in companies which have English speaking offices. This will give you a bit more flexibility with regard to where you want to settle.Commit to a specific country as soon as possible and start learning the language to open up local job markets. Don't underestimate this. I speak several languages fluently and several at full working proficiency. Despite my talent for language acquisition I would need at least 3 years worth of guided (as in: a small classroom with an actual teacher, no duolingo nonsense) language courses to get myself to a full C2 proficiency. Anything less than C2 won't help you, because below that point a local will always be preferred.|||Some things to consider because of your kids: You already said you guys do not have any EU citizenship, yet enrolling them in a Croatian school will make your children have a EU-country school diplomas. Practically all EU countries have a system in place which recognizes each others diplomas, but this is not often the case between the EU and the US, especially because Croatia isn't western europe. This means it might be difficult for your kids to return to the US and get accepted in US colleges.It would be most likely for your kids to attend EU higher education, but without EU citizenship, the tuition fees are generally really high and the EU doesn't really have the scholarship culture as the US because most countries provide their citizens with study stipends and low tuition fees. Other issue: language. Your kids will need to be fluent in Croatian to be able to  feasibly enter the Croatian schooling system. I'm not sure how realistic this will be for your family. All in all, If you decide to go to Croatia with your kids, your kids will most likely need to get IB (International Baccalaureate) diplomas, which are practically world wide recognized and are taught in English. You'll have to properly inform yourself about the availability of such programmes in Croatia (most likely only offered in major cities or even just in their capital Zagreb) and the related costs, which I would guess would be several thousands of euros per child per year.|||After reading through the comments as well... I'm confused.. I speak about a handful of languages, but.. what do all of you mean with doing arithmetics in a language? When I do calculations in my head, they are silent.. I mean, it's math and math is without language. If I have to add numbers.. I 'just' mentally add the numbers and the final amount is just there in my mind or if it's a complex calculation I do it with mental visuals. How do people 'talk' in their head when doing maths?|||**Every** TYPE_MENTION should have a best friend TYPE_MENTION who slaps them in the face from time to time and gets them back down-to-earth.

I can totally see this as a teenager who bitches and moans about everything. If your day as a parent starts out with your child moaning about her favourite jelly not being there for breakfast, that mum hasn't washed that particular piece of clothing she wants to wear and her bitching on her mum that she'll be late for school when her mum needs to take her because of something mum did even though it's her own fault (because teenager logic)... yeah. I get it. And really at that point a parent will fall out after days and weeks of such constant bitching. And at this point I think the child needs to be told to quit it.|||I haven't even considered Hindi, but exactly this kind of info is very useful for language learners like myself.|||How often I haven't told my SO how he's like this over enthusiastic puppy who doesn't know he's grown up yet. This is absolutely the perfect description.Life goals &lt;3 I hope we'll reach that point together as well. I'm not going to say 'I hope we're lucky as well' as if there is one thing I've learned over the past 5 years luck has nothing to do with it. Maintaining a solid and strong relationship is simply a lot of hard work, not some random equation of luck.|||I feel like actually taking a language class is a bit underappreciated on this sub. Yes, there are a lot of very good online resources (often for free), but I will gladly pay for quality classes to keep me at it and to get a lot of high quality feedback on my work, specifically tailored to how I learn. If you have the financial ability and live in a place where a local university of something similar offers language classes, I would highly recommend it.|||Why on earth would you even be in a relationship with someone you *know* it won't work out with. That's setting yourself up for heartbreak for nothing. If you want a very harsh TYPE_MENTION response (and I personally actually do feel like this): you are putting time and energy into a relationship you know will fail, so get out of that relationship to start with and spend your time more usefully. All that time you put in trying to prolong this doomed relationship is wasted and could have been spend on finding and building a relationship with a better match anyway.|||Topvintage.nlIt's a Dutch webshop (but they ship worldwide) which sells newly produced vintage inspired clothes.|||Where are you from and which ones are your favourites?|||I have an interesting perspective on this. I am an very clear TYPE_MENTION, my best friend is a very clear TYPE_MENTION. We are in the same field and organization and work a lot together towards organization improvement. On top of that, we have very closely aligned visions for this organization (our COGFUNC_MENTION tells us both the same). But we differ a lot in how we think our vision should be implemented.For example: we both feel our organization lacks in providing service X to our people, simple because we lack organizational infrastructure. Parts of this service which we envision are provided by different people in the organization already but it's really fracttred and not integrated.I as an TYPE_MENTION have been thinking about this and my solution is to put forward an organization change in which a dedicated department should be developed that integrates all activities we think we should have (and are in some cases already offered on a low effort scale by some), but also offer a lot of new activities to the whole organization that can be offered *because* of the existence of this new organizational unit. For me this also means attracting new people from outside to run this department.My TYPE_MENTION friend when I talk to her about this agrees, but then offers her concerns regarding the loss of human capital of those people already working a bit on that service. How she doesn't want the people who offer the service already to be pushed away to the sidelines and their effort disregarded, even though the current efforts aren't up to the needed standard or scope. She is much more concerned with the people in the organization and how to optimize the status quo as to not rock the boat to much, while I'm really not that concerned about keeping the status quo because frankly, give them a few months and they'll adjust. How I see it: both are extremely good visionaries and leaders. TYPE_MENTION however are more focused on higher level strategy and organizational efficiency, and as such they would be more suited in a C-suite management position. The TYPE_MENTION are much more in tune with the human factor in their organization and are superb in guiding their people towards a new organizational structure (which the TYPE_MENTION developed) because they get the need for higher level strategy and see the possibilities just as well as the TYPE_MENTION. They would be amazing high level Directors. Needless to say, TYPE_MENTION and TYPE_MENTION make an amazing managerial team together.|||You go read up on cognitive functions and realize that TYPE_MENTION and TYPE_MENTION are very different types and do some soul searching to try and objectively look at your character to make a judgement of what truly fits you.|||Yup, it's on my to buy forever list as well.

I think in another thread on r/iwantout ... A couple of US people with maths background were talking about doing a statistics master in Leuven, Belgium (KUL) .. they said it was because of the low tuition fees.. I'm not sure and know nothing about this degree, but you might want to check it out.|||Consider what could happen if you don't involve the PI... Maybe the PI will find out in a few years and a shit storm happens because the PI has now violated many integrity policies regarding title XI, so that means his head is on the line, as well as the PhDs head. It might cost the PhDs his relationship (and as such, referrals and references, fucking up his career) with his PI as a result. I get  you are in a shitty situation, but by deciding to keep the baby you also get to take the responsibilities that come with it (the first of many), including having to talk about it to your PI and very possibly having the quit your current research project and having to start over elsewhere at a different group.|||Of course, the languages you are using in your example are all very closely tied historically and (with the exception of French as a romance languages) are part of the same branch of languages. All of them were the same language once a long time ago.The thing is, this comparison *very* quickly stops being true as soon as you cross those boundaries of historical language groups. Spanish in no way looks like Russian, or Arabic, or Chinese. While an Arabic native speaker will have the same issue with learning Danish, but learning Hebrew would be a lot easier (same branch of language).I do think new languages become easier though especially when you know languages from new branches opposed to knowing several from the same branch. Learning totally foreign languages will force you to struggle with a language on a very analytical level, opposed to simply being able to intuitively understand a language close to your mother tongue. Once you've done that once or twice those analytical skills become second nature and learning new languages is less of a struggle because you see patterns more easily.|||There is a disconnect. It's not like: bad thing A happened, 3 weeks later I cry about bad thing A. I can feel very sad, afraid or frustrated about anything, but won't necessarily cry about it.. I might also cry about something that happened years ago and crept up on me in one of those silent moments. I might also cry for no reason at all, just because I have too much stress built up which needs to be released. I occasionally also cry if I'm watching a movie which might hit too close to home. But I only ever cry in private, and tears are never my main emotional reaction if something happens to me. I sometimes cry in front of my boyfriend about things that bother me, I think I have done so once, maybe twice in our 4 year relationship. I have cried a couple of times more often in front of him, but that was in response to him being emotional and in pain, and it hurt me so much I had to cry because *he* was hurting.|||Thanks for your input. I'll have a look at the FB group!|||Supply Chain Management and Operation Management would be a masters studies to be continued after a bachelor in Business Administration.What you are saying about subjects outside your major should hold true for a bachelor business administration as well. I'm currently doing a BSc in BA and will do SCM as a master and I too have done accounting/marketing and all that stuff. It's quite usual to have a broad bachelor and a specialized master. The thing is, in Europe bachelor programmes are not really considered starting degrees, so where in the US you'll need to specialize in something during college (because those are considered starting degrees) the *true* specialization in Europe is done during graduate school and not bachelors.|||Leiden in the Netherlands has an English bachelor programme in archeology, but like you said, the Netherlands can be expensive for foreigners (i'm guessing it would be aroung 7-10k a year). Maybe some German universities offer those courses in English, Germany has very low tuition fees as well.. Just a word of warning: Dutch is one of the most difficult languages to learn as a foreigner. I have multiple family members who emigrated to the Netherlands and had to take Dutch language courses to get their permanent visa's etc and it the one who I saw it do fastest was my stepmother who was in her early thirties and already spoke 3-4 languages fluently and it took her 1,5-2 years with a constant effort of 4-5 hours a day / 5 days a week to get to a full B2 on all 4 subjects (hearing, listening, speaking, writing) and she was actually in the Netherlands getting guided lessons multiple times a week at our university and got out to speak with locals etc. Not telling you it's impossible, but it will be hard and you should know what you're getting into when deciding to make such a big step. The CEFR level of B2 is usually achieved after about 600 hours of *guided* learning (compared to C1 which should take an average student another 200-300 hours extra), if you want to get there in a year it would mean an average person would need 11 guided hours a week for a full year.|||It was a physical systems course, focussing on electrical systems (which is totally not my forte).I broke my ankle, which needed 2 surgeries (and 2 months of non weight bearing + massive amounts of painkillers) and intensive PT for many months after that. A year post op I still had massive pain, and the conclusion was the first surgery wasn't succesful and they needed to redo everything by surgically breaking my ankle again. Within 2 weeks of that surgery I also had another surgery scheduled, this time on my jaw, in which they had to saw off my upper jaw and reposition it (fixing a 'birth defect' issue). Two major surgeries in 10 days, 10/10, would absolutely recommend /s. And again 2 months non weight bearing and intense pain, followed by loads of PT. I'll need at least another year of PT to be somewhat pain free again, until that time, every fucking step I take hurts and if I try to do too much, I literally can't walk the day after.I had to be hospitalized yesterday for an acute infection of my ankle. We are now trying to figure out if it's a deep wound infection (in which case I'm royally screwed and will need surgery asap) or if it's 'just' a simple infection, but even then, my bloodwork came back with a ridiculously CRP (infection fighting protein) count, so even if it's 'just' a simple infection I'll need heavy antibiotics.Like I said, life told me fuck you many times already, I'm luckily still stubborn enough to tell life fuck you too.|||What on earth.... You can't really *believe* this kind of logic right? Your mum being less important than your dad, simply because he has a penis he likes to stick in other people? Lot's of people are telling you to mind your own business, but.. this is your family for fucks sake! They are discussing this with you openly, it *is* your business now..Is this the kind of situation and family you'd like to bring your own girlfriend/wife into? If you keep this to yourself and not tell those women in your family, because loyalty to the men comes before loyalty to the women.. how do you think that would reflect on *you* as a man to your (future) partner? I think you are making the right choice in telling your SIL and mother.If I were you.. just.. I don't know, probably call them up, tell them: 'hey, I just thought you should know about some things that your husband said to me.' and tell them what they told you and leave it at that. Let the women decide how they want to handle that situation, that's not up to you.|||I actually understand what you are saying. I had a breakdown yesterday evening where I cried my eyes out because my studies is not something I enjoy. I recognize myself in you as well, as studying comes very easy to me too The thing is, I don't care about being and engineer, I care about what engineering can do. Mostly just like you thinking about how engineering can help people who were born in less lucky circumstances. I chose engineering for what it will bring me later on in live: being able to work for engineering/industrial companies that make beautiful and worthwhile things happen. I don't want to be the one who models a chemical reactor, but I do want to be the one who recognizes opportunities for growth and innovation in parts of the chemical industry and lead the company I work for to do better in those areas. But studying engineering has nothing to do with that business side of things. This is when I picked up a second degree in Business Administration specializing in technology management. A few year later and I realize those courses can't get me to wake up happy and energized in the mornings either. The things that do make me happy are my extracurricular projects which I develop and lead. I came to realize that I'm on the right career path and that engineering will be the right choice for that career, but I also came to realize I simply HATE studying. But you know what.. that's OK. You don't have to like your studies for those couple of year to get your diploma if it's a means to and end to be able to do what you do like for the next *50 years* of your life.|||Ok, that's good!

Maybe your outfit IRL is different than I imagined it if you say the cups are covered and cleavage is limited. My comment was really based on the feeling that everything together (bands+cups+cleavage) would simply be too much of a 'sexy' outfit for a place that's not really suited for it (sportsbar during the day vs a club at night).|||In that case, be smart and start learning German! German universities do usually not have English taught bachelor degrees and life in Germany overall will be much better if you know the language. Start now and you'll have another 3-4 years. You should be able to get your proficiency up to B2 of European reference framework if you work hard at it.|||I'm Dutch, not English. Not sure about the UK system, but I do know they are in general more expensive compared to the Dutch system.In the Netherlands, the government controls the maximum health insurance companies can ask for basic insurance (~100 euros/month), as well as controlling the maximum amount of mandatory deductible an insurance company may ask (~400 euros/year). On top of that, they also put maxima on the amount hospitals may bill to insurance companies for each procedure. It's a highly controlled system, which leaves room for *some* but little profit, as such, costs for the average citizen are kept to a minimum.|||I definitely chose engineering as a solid career choice instead of out of live for the field. I had the grades and (luckily!) talent to get into any degree programme I wanted, and I had a very wide interest as well, so choosing my degree was a bit of an issue. So I got together with my dad and we discussed what I wanted out of my degree, which included criteria on educational quality and future career paths with good incomes. In the end, I chose engineering.|||I *hate* it when people call it accidents as if they try to get rid of their responsibility.

PT is not necessarily included in insurance, only if you insure yourself for it specifically in which case you'll be covered for a certain amounts worth of sessions or when you have certain chronic conditions, in which case basic insurance will cover PT sessions after having to pay for the first 20 yourself, either through additional insurance packages like mentioned before, or by paying out of pocket.All PT clinics are independently run and have to negotiate for themselves whether their services are accepted for coverage by insurance companies. They need to have these negations with every insurer separately.In all other matters, individuals will pay for their sessions out of pocket, directly to the clinic without the insurance company coming in between.|||It never is.

Do this regardless of whether or not you decide to move to Europe, a passport is an incredibly powerful item to have. And yes, Croatia is member of the EU, so you'll have an EU passport which will allow you to travel and work in any EU country without a visa. The rules for unmarried partners differ per EU country, but for spouses (and other direct family members) the EU offer a non-EEA family member visa, which essentially allows your spouse to travel, life and work with you through all of Europe, as long as you travel together. So yes, marriage solves a lot of your problems in this case. Work options are an issue though, especially in combination with you only speaking English.. You're not in a highly skilled field for which you'd be able to find work for online or something.. I don't know, maybe other redditors can help you on this one.|||No colleges as in if you want a university level degree in Europe you need to attend a full blown research university and participate in research. We have little to no colleges, as in places that are pure educational institutions, on university level, only on lower vocational levels.Many students choose to take a gap year and work + travel the world, backpacking in Asia/Australia is very popular, especially because Europeans can very easily obtain working holiday visas. If someone makes the wrong choice: they simply switch, but yes this does come at an extra cost. But then again, when tuition is 0 to a few grand a year and the government provides social loans, the impact is very little. My country for example offers students government loans at an interest of 0.4%, payback period of 35 years, but only a maximum of 4% of your income ABOVE minimum wage.|||Because most western countries have banks that offer debit cards with at times, even better fraud protection than credit card companies.

To me, it makes the difference between simply too tight and just on the edge professional.|||I'm not sure if it's the wisest idea ever to put your full real name + contact information online on a public forum like reddit..|||If OP doesn't have money for a bike, he certainly won't have the money for a knee surgery.|||In the Netherlands we have 'adult schools' which you can go to if you didn't get a high school diploma (for example if you're an immigrant), want a higher level diploma (for example if you did a Mittlere Reife and want an Abitur diploma) or didn't pass the Abitur exam. They allow you to retake single courses at a specific high school level, as in, you could retake your maths Abitur exam only. If you have something similar in Germany and you explain yourself in your application letter I can imagine that would be enough.|||Your post is super old, but I came across it so I'm commenting anyway:Groningen has a lot of clubs and pubs, but considering the size of the city, of course the scene will not be as large and high tech as in Dubai. That being said, you should definitely know that Groningen is the *only* city in the Netherlands that does *not* have mandatory closing hours. Even in Amsterdam, all clubs and bars have to close at a certain time at night. In Groningen, all clubs and bars are free to close whenever they want. This means that quite some pubs decide to close only when the last people decide to actually leave. It's not uncommon to see party goers going *home* while you're biking through the city on your way to class.|||If OP thinks the boss is one step too far, she can also consider figuring out if her uni has a mentoring programme for young professors. At my uni, all untenured professors get a full prof mentor from outside of their research unit. If her uni has something similar, talking to her professors mentor might be a less drastic step to take.|||It's an amazing song isn't it? Luckily it is getting less and less relevant with every new generation, but I like how her song is just really honest about the struggle of women just some 60 years ago or so without being overly aggressive about it like many other feminist songs.|||For me it was a bit of a hassle, because my mother never renewed her passport after the fall of Yugoslavia and there are a bit of weird rules that come into play at that point. If your mum has true Serbian nationality, the process is super straightforward, get her birth certificate, a copy of her passport and your birth certificate (if they are not in Serbian you need an official apostille translation) and bring everything to your local Serbian embassy. There are two processes: first you need to get citizenship, then with your citizenship you can apply for a passport. Applying for citizenship by decent would cost maybe 10 euros at my embassy, it's super cheap. But it can takes months and in my case, over a year, the be processed. Also, you need to be below 23 years of age if you want to apply for citizenship by decent. It turned out that my mum is now formally Bosnian due to the strange rules and instead of trying for citizenship by decent, I went for citizenship by heritage. Serbian law states that anyone who can show that they belong to the Serbian ethnic group and as such are part of the Serbian diaspora, can claim Serbian citizenship. I brought in the same documents as above and also my baptism certificate of my (Russian) Orthodox church. As my mums birth certificate also showed the names of my grandparents and everyone has *really* Serbian names, plus I was baptised in the Orthodox church (no Serbian Orthodox Church in the region) I was able to 'prove' Serbian heritage and got to apply for citizenship through that route. This route doesn't have a maximum age, but is a lot more expensive, I paid about 200-300 euros. I'll go back to the embassy soon to apply for my passport, which is about 50 euros.|||First an foremost: in the next 5 years or so, your relationship with your mum will change drastically, baby or no baby. You will become an adult, your relationship will become less parent to child and more adult to adult.Ok. That being said, I truly understand your feelings as I have been through the same (even posted about it on reddit as well one time). My stepmum became pregnant within months of me moving out for university. Downvotes or note: I do not really love my baby brother, because I do not have a relationship with him. I have my own life and I'll always be an only child, just like my baby brother. I have my life and frankly, it's just a feeling of not caring about it really.. as awful as it may sound. Maybe this will change later on in my life, maybe not. The thing is, my relationship with my dad did *not* change whatsoever in terms of love, only in terms on the natural process of moving from childhood to adulthood. We talk like we always talk, he cares like he always cared. And yes, he updates me about my baby brother, but we still talk way more about the cats I grew up with than the kid. You are 16 now, probably going on 17. Before the child is born. You'll be 18 and on your way out to live your own life. I think you'd have a lot more to 'fear' if you'd be 13 for example. As you'll be on your own by the time the kid comes around, the kid will not in *any* way have to interefere with your relationship with your mum.By the way, whether you'd like to have the best brother/sister relationship in the world or not, you need to shut your mum down on being a 'mother figure' for the kid ASAP. You'll be a sister, not a mother, not a baby sitter, *not a caregiver whatsoever*. She wants a kid, she needs to take care of it. Shut that talk down immediately.|||Ok, take Elon Musk. He's not TYPE_MENTION but a pretty good example nonetheless. His major goal in life is to make humans colonize Mars. To do so, he started SpaceX. He realized he needed super batteries as well to achieve this goal, so he started Tesla. He realized he needed new, more efficient ways of using solar energy, so he helped fund Solar City. Everything he does is to benefit his major goal in life, by pursuing smaller but still big goals that lead to the bigger goal. This is true for most TYPE_MENTION who have a vision and/or idea of what they want from life, which may or may not be an idealistic dream like Mars colonization. This can also be something more 'selfish' for example retiring before turning 50 and travel the world. The big picture drives every step of the TYPE_MENTION, and while the big picture might be a very personal and emotional goal, all steps towards the big picture are driven by reason in an effort to get to the big picture the quickest way posible. So no. Hedonism doesn't play a role, because TYPE_MENTION are simply never done with getting to their ultimate goal and simply keep on going. That's how we roll.|||Do me a favor.

This is also why I dress hyper feminine. Think a lot of 50s based feminine skirts and dresses. Men who are (subconsciously) stuck in gender roles and have some sexist sides to their personality get really fucked up when they meet the 'TYPE_MENTION man with boobs' who dresses like a pretty bombshell.|||I study best in a formal classroom setting, with guided classes, homework and class participation. Each semester currently costs me 250-300 euros for tuition and books. Meaning I spend about 500-600 euros per language per year. Sure, you could do without, but the quality of having professionals teach me in a structured way is worth it to me, also in terms of forcing a disciplined and consistent time investment into my studies, which gives me a higher output in terms of how quickly I learn.|||In my case, it's engineering.. but really, it's just an overarching way of talking about science and engineering disciplines.. because for my story, it really doesn't matter if I had studied computer science, physics or chemical engineering (which I study).. all would have been fine. I actually started out with chemistry before switching to engineering, if I hadn't, my story wouldn't have changed for it.|||Are you trying to type yourself? I'm asking because like others said, this seems mostly like a very stressful social anxiety situation. I really don't think you should try typing yourself based on what functions you show during a stressful episode. Why? Because people react differently than normal during stress, either through their inferior function, but at times even through shadow functions depending on how integrated and deep your anxiety is.You definitely can't claim a dominant function by applying function analysis to a high stress situation like this, because it won't be a dominant function that's most prominent during these situations.|||The thing is, we use a 10 point scale, where a full 10.0 is the highest grade possible and a 5.5 is a passing grade. However, this is in no way based on a percentage scale and even though a 10 is the highest grade possible, this does not equate an A or even an A+. When you do statistics, you'll see that a full 10.0/10 score is only given in like 0.6% of all tests even though a 10/10 is possible to get if you simply don't make *any* mistakes. Getting an 8/10 most often (especially in STEM) will put you in the top 10% of grades.That nice example of you teacher making tests which are practically impossible to score over 80% on? Well, welcome to our education system where every friking exam is designed like that.So no, a nice american curved grade that's a A+ or something will not give you a 10/10, or even a 9/10, maybe a 8/10 if the curve cut off is strong enough (remember 8/10 is on average a top 10% score or sometimes even higher).|||So, we have different types of associations: study associations (yours would be [Clio](https://www.clio.nl/home) ), sports associations and student associations. Clio is 100% open to internationals and has English as their main language, so no problem there. With the sports association it depends, my experience is that many of them simply never had an international member become very active within the association, but they are open to it and once an international joins, they are very easy in changing the commonly used language. The bigger ones however should  have no issue accepting internationals, as they probably have had more experience with them already. Then there are student associations, which can be seen somewhat as sororities/fraternities. The student associations all have a very unique culture, some of the traditional ones (Vindicat, Albertus Magnus) probably are not very open to internationals, but for example the student associations who focuses more on the alternative scene (Cleopatra), have been actively working towards making their association international. So I guess the answer with student associations is 'it depends'.|||So, when was your grandfather born?|||That's the first thing I did when things started going south.

Depending on your exact discipline this may or may not be relevant in your case. Many of the current projects that have been developed over the past year or so had  brexit clauses. Lots of stories of companies losing their major contracts because of the vote, because of which those companies are now likely to go bankrupt soon.|||Are you *sure* this is an TYPE_MENTION? I mean, sure there is variation across TYPE_MENTION, but *in general* TYPE_MENTION are actually very strong at reading the room and picking up on very slight social cues. TYPE_MENTION may be very direct themselves as if they don't care about social cues, but the only reason we get away with it is because we read other people well enough to know how to deal with people efficiently and with as little effort as possible. The manipulative streaks most people notice in TYPE_MENTION are also related to exactly this, TYPE_MENTION know how to push the right buttons in people's heads to get them to do what they want.|||In this discussion I honestly believe there is a strong distinction between carrying a child to birth and whatever happens after.A woman has an undeniable right to her own bodily autonomy with regard to whether or not the child will be carried to birth. A woman may always abort the child no matter what. However, when the child is born we are playing a completely different game, because bodily autonomy isn't in play anymore. This is why I have always hated the abortion vs adoption vs keeping it discussion. So: I think we can all agree that both mother and father to the child after birth carry equal rights and responsibility to the life they helped create. A man has the obligation to pay child support if he does not wish to be involved with the child, because of his responsibility in actually putting this child on the earth. What everyone is always forgetting is that **this is also true for the mother**. A mother may very well decide to give up her parental rights to her child, have nothing to do with it and give the father sole custody. In this case it is the mother who will be paying child support on the same premise as to why men are paying child support. It is only after both parents relinquish their rights to the child when adoption comes into play.|||But the thing is, she *chose* to have children and taking care of them until you die is kind of exactly the deal you sign up for. But you never chose to be born, you never got to make that decision and accept responsibility. This is also exactly the reason why ' I want to have kids so they can take care of me when I'm old' is so fucked up.|||Do know that most degrees require at least B2 level proficiency, look it up, the system is called 'European Reference Framework' and look some examples of B2 level in *English* so you can have feeling how far along you are with your Italian.|||This so much.

Do know however that if you want to do translation/interpretation it will most likely only be freelance for private projects. If you want to be a translator/interpreter for any kind of legal, medical, or political goals you need to get formal education. For example, translators for the NATO who deal with translating legal documents need to have a law degree and formal language education at university level. I think you need to think *really* hard about what your exact goals are long term with regard to 'wanting to learn new languages and find some kind of a job that has to do with those languages'.|||Dutch is hard because it's a big fucked up language made up from several others with an additional Dutch sauce on top. This makes it incredibly easy for Dutch people to learn new European languages as they can fall back on their 'Dutch intuition' to a certain degree, but vice versa is difficult.Small typical example: most languages either make a distinction in noun genders (French, German) and it affects grammar, for example 'la mÃ¨re et le pÃ¨re/ma mÃ¨re et mon pÃ¨re', and if a language doesn't (English, mostly in any case) it doesn't influence grammar either, example 'the mother and the father/my mother and my father'. However, in Dutch it's a mix, because we *do* make a difference between feminine/masculine vs neuter articles before nouns, but not when using possessives. For example 'de moeder en het kind' but 'mijn moeder en mijn kind'(the mother and the child/my mother and my child). Mother is feminine and thus has the article 'de' but child is a neuter gender noun and such has the article 'het'. However, the possesive form in both cases in 'mijn'. To make it even more difficult: the language has evolved to a point you can't say based on how a noun is written (such as in German) whether it's feminine/masculine or neuter. So you have to learn for each new noun from the top of your head whether it's 'de' or 'het'. For example: 'stoel' (chair), you tell me what gender this noun is!Similar situations are also true for verb conjugations, where you have a set of different rules for verb groups which are about the same and together make up about 70% of all verbs and 30% are totally irregular so those need to be learned by heart.Here you can see the mix and match fuck up of languages and grammar the Dutch language is. That's why it's difficult: for a new Dutch language learning, the Dutch language simply doesn't make *sense*.|||Don't worry about sport facilities. Google ACLO, which is a fully student run sports centre (I believe the biggest in Europe even). They have a huuuge fitness facility on the campus where you'll be studying, that's open most of the day. Also, almost next to the Economics and Business department, you'll also find an indoor swimming pool, which you can also use as an ACLO member. The swimming pool usually has 4 open hours during the day (early mornings, during lunch, after classes end of the day and late in the evening). You can sign up for an ACLO membership at any time. I think it's about 120 euro *a year* for regular membership + unlimited fitness.|||Ok, so, how are you financially? In my country, tuition is super low.. I'm doing all kinds of projects and extra curriculars, without having to honestly care about the added cost for 2-3 extra years at university. I think this will also be an important factor, because if you are strapped for cash, the decision to continue with the chance you'll drop out later will be a far harder one to make.But, I do understand what you are saying, I also really hate studying in general, I just hate studying business a bit less, because the business projects always encourage you to come up with your own ideas and topics, which allows me to steer those projects into directions that interest me.. but, really just *studying*.. nope, not my cup of tea.. but frankly, it's what I need for my career, so I'll suck it up for a few years so I can have the career I enjoy for another 50 years.|||If you want to 'kiss ass' with an TYPE_MENTION the best approach is to say to your boss about some essential part of your work: I like your feedback, and please don't sugarcoat it. Expect some harsh comments, depending on how you deal with criticism it might hurt your feelings, ask questions about the comments if you don't understand it 100%, thank your boss for the feedback and time, say you'll improve and tell him you'd like his feedback again in X time to evaluate your improvements. And actually improve your work. Like others said: TYPE_MENTION are able to play the political manipulation games, because they have an incredible bull shit radar. Which means to are able to see through everyone who is trying to play games on *them*. Don't try to beat them at their own game, you won't win and it won't get you anywhere.

Anyways, to answer your question: medical care, including nursing homes are subsidized by the government through our tax system (*Algemene wet bijzonder ziektekosten*). I wouldn't be able to give you the exact details, but a quick google search following reading through their website says most of it is compensated by the government, but you have to pay an extra income based amount which is about 12.5% of your yearly income. On top of that there are costs for hairdressers, laundry etc which has to be paid.|||I remember seeing the Lion King on West End two months back or so. We paid for premium tickets, these are about 100 pounds each. We sat down and an American family of 5 sat in front of us (including snacks for 5 people they easily dropped 600 pounds to see that show). My SO and I looked at each other like 'Oh shit'. The parents however treated everything like a strict boot camp. Every little noise or annoying movement got reprimanded on the spot. It was amazing.|||I think your last paragraph is really important. We as women are mostly still raised with the idea that you ought to have children, that's simply the natural course of your life. And this has been true for centuries, but not anymore.

Your child will still have another 40-50 years with you and will be able to have you in his/her life for guidance for a *long* time to come. Your child can depend on you for advice on building a career and starting a family and raising kids. Having a baby after 35-40 years old, is not that much of an issue, if you take the responsibility of caring for yourself and your body for the sake of your child.I'm now in my 20s, my dad recently had a baby with my stepmum and he's well in his 50s. My baby brother will most likely have to deal with the death of my father by the time he's a bit older than I am now (based on average life expectancy for his age and lifestyle). My baby brother will likely not have a father by the time his career starts to kick off, or when he gets married, or when he gets children. Yes, anything can happen, anyone might die tomorrow, but if we approach this  based on the probability of such awful things happening, I do belief it was incredibly selfish of my dad to have a new child who he wouldn't able to guide through life.|||Thanks for this!|||Must be our amazing COGFUNC_MENTION that's enjoying our self inflicted masochism of enduring endless kicks to the butt.|||Italy is a whole different world during summer, compared to off season months.

All EU higher education is streamlined through the Bologna process, which makes sure an university bachelor degree from Spain is qualified on the same level as an university bachelor in Denmark.

Once someone exists, dying is the prerequisite action needed to not exist.  I do not wish to go through that action, it goes against my human instict to sustain life if anything.

Most European countries don't actually have a difference between citizenship and nationality. Citizenship = having that countries passport. I don't know the specifics for each and every country though. However, your specific questions about health care and education aren't necessarily related to your citizenship. There could be rules on this regarding what kind of residence visa you have, or how long you've been living in the country. But again, this differs for every country. however, when talking about education cost (especially higher education) most countries have different rates for EU citizens and non-EU citizens but again, that's linked to having a European passport.|||I think the bigger problem is that in the US there are very few laws about vacation etc. In my (more socialist) country there are laws saying that you need to receive a minimum of 4x the average number of hours you work a week in vacation time. If you work full time: that's *at least* 3 weeks a year and most unions have successfully demanded even more. You actually get extra money in May from the government to book a vacation etc, literally called 'vacation money'! (Sure you 'saved' it yourself by paying taxes, but still, it shows how much such a thing is valued by society). If your country has systems in place that guarantee personal development and health in terms of rest, being able to work part time and still have a decent income etc etc, than it also wouldn't be an issue to have paternity/maternity leave for 'special' occasions like childbirth on top of it. (Or being ill, or wanting to take a sabbatical, or to go back to school, etc)|||I'm 22 now, I have had two boyfriends, my first at 15 years old (which lasted about a year), my second at 18 years old and I'm still together with him after 3.5 years and counting. When I was 15, the first guy was a bit older than me, and like you, I had very strong feelings about not feeling ready. Like you, I was quite strong in standing my ground regarding this. My first boyfriend was totally OK with this. And he waited, and waited, for *months* never doing something more intimate than we already had unless I initiated it. My second boyfriend was the same (although he didn't *need* to wait months because I felt ready a lot sooner with him). The thing is, yes, this guy has the right to want sex with you, but he doesn't have the right to expect sex (let alone *demand* sex!) from you. A man who does not understand this and who's reaction is anything different than that of my two boyfriends (\\\"that's totally OK, I'll wait, no problem, I love you!\\\") does not respect women. Period. And as a young woman who already is firm in her own belief that you yourself need to be ready to commit to intimacy, you should also decide for yourself that you under no circumstances should commit to men who do not respect you. Men who respect women are not unicorns, also not at your age. The fact that I found multiple in a few years time proofs it. You should aim for nothing less yourself as well.|||I'm a female student in STEM, and although I have zero ambition to stay in science, I'm starting a mentoring programme for female graduate students in which they get teamed up with young and upcoming female professors exactly because of this fucking reason. So many female students wouldn't even consider becoming a scientist because either they want children but think it's incompatible with also becoming a professor one day, or they only see this kind of fucked up sexism. There are *so* few women like you (with or without children) that female students literally can't see you and have decent role models.|||So, this day was a big emotional mess and neither of you has properly processed everything that happened. I think both of you - despite the emotional mess - handled this situation very maturely through a lot of open and honest communication. Walking away when it got too much only to keep talking again when you gathered your thoughts was a really good mature thing to do. Anyway... I would advise not to suddenly step in an open relationship. Tell your SO you want to give the two of you a week or two to talk things through and see how you are feeling after those 2 weeks. If you are both still onboard with opening up, you can actually decide to do so.Anyway. My male SO went through something similar and discovered his bisexuality some years into our LTR. I am in every sense of the world 100% heterosexual. This was difficult for him to process and admit to me, mainly due to social stigma. He feels a lot more comfortable about his sexuality now, a few years later. We solved this by openly talking about our attractions towards other people among ourselves. My SO allowed himself to tell me 'wow, that guy is hot' when we would be walking down the streets and I would comment back whether I'd agree with him or not. He'd talk to me about some of his gay fantasies and why it would excite him or not. I would ask him honest question and not judge him in anyway. In the end, that was enough for him and we are still together in a monogamous relationship, as he realized that gender doesn't matter, he loves me as a person and wants to be with me. But now, he simply doesn't have to hide from me or himself and can truly just be himself in our relationship.|||What on earth America! This is ridiculous!

You should google dentist/tandarts Groningen and find one that is taking clients, as many don't. About insurance, it will really depend on your own insurer to be honest. You will most likely have to pay yourself and declare your bill yourself with your insurance company. Most people in the Netherlands aren't insured for dental care (me neither) but pay out of pocket, as additional dental insurance is often more expensive than the yearly costs for check ups, the occasional extraction and the occasional fillings. The thing is, dental care costs are regulated by the government with prices set for each specific procedure. You can find the pdf with all prices here: https://www.nza.nl/1048076/1048144/TB_REG_17614_02__Tandheelkundige_zorg.pdf It's in Dutch though, so I'll help you out. You will be charged on items H11 (removal tooth, ~40 euros) and H16 (removal tooth, subsequent teeth, ~30 euros), your dentist will probably also insist on two x-rays, one of each side, to evaluate whether they *can* remove your wisdom teeth in their clinic or whether surgical intervention is needed. These are items X10 (small x ray, ~15 euros per x ray). So all together, extraction of your two wisdom teeth should be about 100 euros total. Another thing you should consider, if you are at the dentist to begin with, is to ask for a check up if you haven't had one in the past year or so, this is item C11 (general consult, ~20 euros).If the dentist decided something is wrong with your wisdom teeth (for example, if they lie sideways), they will refer you for surgical extraction at the hospital. At this point, in terms of Dutch insurance, medical insurance kicks in which includes having to pay your deductible, although the surgical procedure itself should be covered. But again, whether it's covered for you, will depend on your own insurance.|||My mother actually gave me that book a few years ago as a 'I cant put it to words myself, but I want to tell you what my love for you is like' gift. I respect the hell out of parents who are a real Giving Tree, because she's right, that's exactly what a good parent should be.. but damn.. it's a depressing book.|||1. You will need about 10k Euros in your bank account at the start of *every* year. You will need to show this bank statement to immigrations to get your student visa for that year. Meaning, you need 10k in cash + all the living expenses for that year, as you can't really use the cash from that 10k if you can't guarantee you'll be able to fill it up back again to 10k before the year ends.2. If you are gifted in learning languages, it *might* be possible, if you make studying German a priority (I mean daily practice of 4-5 hours) and you do full immersion with your boyfriend outside of dedicated practice. But, you don't have a year. If language is an admission requirement, you will most likely need to give your proof of language proficiency (Goethe certificate?) when applying, which is.. what will it be.. 6 months before the start of the programme? That means you need to have your certificate in time, which will depend on testing dates at one of your local language testing institutes and on processing time of getting you your certificate. So, realistically, you have maybe 6 months, not 1 year. Anyway. You have a bachelors right? If you are serious about this, you should look for a masters degree that's offered in English, which I'm sure are around. This will cut the language requirement.|||Like I said: the US really has the top universities of the world, but than again, also only a small part of the population attends Yale and the like. We have a tiered high school system starting from the age of 12. One tier towards vocational education (60% of the population), on towards applied sciences education (25%) and one towards university education (15%). I know *many* students who got into respectable but not world famous universities based on high school diplomas which wouldn't allow them to enter a university in this country. Even more so: there diplomas weren't even considered an equivalent to Dutch universities so when they came back to the Netherlands to start a university education, they had to start all over again.|||Anything that takes longer then a few hours is not a task anymore. I'd break it up in smaller actual tasks (use a project page if needed). If it's something like 'for the next couple of days I need to write code for about 4 hours a day' I don't journal it (or plan it as an event), but simply plan less tasks during that day. It's a mental calculation of how much time I have in a day and whether a tasks will still fit tomorrow for example, if not, I plan it a day later or switch some tasks around.|||I read through all the comments and there seems to be a sort of general consensus of how to approach this subject. I am currently also a 21 year old in a long term relationship and madly in love, so I'm also thinking about how I would personally react. I think the key thing to take away is to treat your daughter with respect and as an *adult* not your young adult child. The moment I would feel old enough to marry (even if I wasn't truly) I would completely shut down to moment my parents would belittle me and treat me like a child who knows nothing. For me, that would be a 'I'm an adult and I can make adult decisions!' kind of feeling and the only way for you to get your point across will be to go along with that train of thought. So: support her in her engagement, congratulate her and tell her what an adult decision she is making and she is truly becoming an adult now. Be positive about it. Then continue on with the consequences of becoming an adult. Reading through the comments there are two main issues to be discussed:1. Now that she is an adult she will have to support herself and can no longer rely on her parents, because she is now starting a new core family unit. You said in one of the comments that you're not prepared to cut her of financially, even if married. That's fine, but she doesn't have to *know* this. Let her think that she's all by herself if she does this, maybe she'll reconsider. You can always come back to this conclusion and tell her once she is married that you'll support her anyway. 2. Her green card status and how this will affect her visa etc. I would also like to make a third point which is not yet made a lot by the commenters, but this is what came to my mind when you said Nate's family being traditional and religious:3. Talk to her about her future plans regarding starting a family and what kind of career she wants. Use this discussion as a build up towards pre-marital counseling. I'm saying this because I'm getting the feeling that in this case getting married early also comes hand in hand with the underlying expectations starting a family will come early and having traditional gender roles in the marriage.. this may not be at all what your daughter wants, but she simply doesn't understand yet. Also, I guess it would be good to push her to get long term birth control *before marriage* if she doesn't want a child soon and support her in this.. because it will be a hell of a lot easier for her to get out of this marriage in a few years if no children are involved. But again: all of these discussion should be adult, rational discussion like you'd have them with your own spouse or mother. No guilt tripping, be supportive but be a pain in the ass realist to her.|||Ik ben erg benieuwd naar hoe dit verloopt.

The whole point of Bitcoin is making all transactions public so the community at large is in control of the financial system and oversight, instead of banks. So every transaction, every mined bitcoin and the full history of where every bitcoin essentially came from can be accessed in a public ledger. But, it won't show you names, it will only show you when a certain bitcoin came into existence (it was mined) and which transactions flow from address X to address Y to address Z etc.|||Hey OP, I'm in the same situation with my boyfriend. He recently started going to a professional and medication is a topic that's on the table. I have very little  experience with depression, he's the first and only one to have to deal with it among my friends and relatives. Needless to say, I'm worried sick about him. There are also very little resources for partners of depressed people online. Your post really gave me a happy perspective on my own situation. Would you mind if I PM'd you with some more in depth questions about how him taking medication affects you as his partner?|||Yes, we have similar social security rules which state that your employer must keep paying your salary (your taxes paid for it!) and you can't be fired during that time.|||And here I am, sitting next to my childfree boyfriend of 4 years watching how he's going through some Skyrim dungeons, while redditing myself.

That job won't come easy for sure, but if you don't mind manual labour for the first year or 2 you'll find something. This is especially important because you'll be immersed in the culture and pick up the language faster. About getting an education: higher education institutions have special tests to assess the capabilities of people like you, who didn't get the right papers because reasons. Anyone above 21 years old can take them. Sometimes called '21+ toets' but often also called 'Colloquium Doctum'. The only way to get into the cheaper bracket for tuition (2000 euros a year) would be based on certain 'verblijfsvergunningen' or residence permits. The government website should have more information of this, but be assured: it's probably not in the cards for you anywhere in the next 5 years. On a more positive note: at least at university level *many* programmes are offered in English, so language will most likely not be an issue. International Business has a somewhat neutral job perspective, compared to other degrees.|||Any idea what kind of BSc you want to get?

For example, Santa Catarina to Tokyo gives an absolute bottom price of 800 euros for a return ticket, but to do so, you'll need to get a bus to Sao Paulo which takes 7-8 hours extra travel time. You'll need to fill in the dates to get prices for your specific travel period, but if you're lucky you might be able to cut costs in half.|||Just to have a comparison: median *household* income in the Netherlands is 34k|||Do minors really matter? In my country employers wouldn't give a shit even if you minored in theatre or whatever, as long as you have your engineering diploma in the end... If it is similar in your country and especially if your tuition is high, you'd be mad not to go the chem minor route.I also believe 'I tried it, it turned out not to be something Im interested in and this reassured my decision to get into field X' is a perfectly fine story to tell during interviews etc.|||Fuck that shit! Listen, I'm also in a 3 year long relationship and around your age. I've had my boyfriend ask me not to wear certain things, because for example it reminds him of a specific style of his ex which he doesn't want to be reminded of. Ok, fine, I won't wear it on a date with him, I get it, but I like that dress, so if I have a day which doesn't actively involve him, I'll still wear it.Sometimes he is just 'meh' about some of my clothing to which I tell him 'It makes *me* happy and feel attractive' and that's the end of it and he'll accept it.This behaviour of him being *obsessive* over how you dress is NOT normal.He's reasoning is also ridiculous: I think you are fat, therefore I don't think you are attractive and as such I need to control whether of not you wear a ponytail. You're an intelligent woman, you can't *really* buy into this line of reasoning do you?If he is not happy with you, if you are not good enough for him.. have you every asked yourself why *he* doesn't break up with you instead of him passive-aggressively telling you to break up with him if you don't like his behaviour?Listen, I am also not super attractive and I also got in a shitty medical situation in which I gained about 10 kg (about 25 lbs-ish). We are the same age. We have similar length relationships. My boyfriend tells me daily how much he loves me, how he thinks I'm beautiful, how he thinks I'm sexy and how he's sure there is no way in hell he'll ever find a more attractive girlfriend. I'm talking 2-3 times a day *minimum*. He did so since the beginning of our relationship and this hasn't changed a bit. You can have such a relationship too, I'm sure, this is not any fairy talePrince Charming behaviour, this is really normal in a relationship to give each other regular compliments and make each other feel loved and wanted.. but I'm not so sure whether that will happen with this guy because I don't see him change his behaviour to be honest.... Ask yourself whether you'd be able to accept this behaviour long term, as in marriage/rest of your life long term... if not... well... you know...|||You do admit you spend a lot on nonessential luxuries so you should be able to save up on an emergency fund even with your current job. The point of having an emergency fund is not touching it! You use it when suddenly the car breaks down and needs 100s of dollars in repair. Or when you need to move out on a moment notice because of whatever reason. Or if you or your GF lost your job and you need money until you find yourselves new jobs.|||If you find a sub or whatever that's exactly this, please let me know!|||Yes, I'm joining! 20s F from the Netherlands. I only just started my weight loss journey last month, lost 1kg up till now. Goal for august is to loose 1.5 and hopefully even 2 kg.I'm doing a 1200 kcal daily diet, at least in theory, however, being a student there are *lots* of BBQ and parties and getting together with friends. I've noticed that I'm having issues with those in terms of diet, because I simply don't want to give up on all the nice craft beers, nice food, nice cheese, etc. So frankly, I'm not really doing 1200 a day, I'm doing 'only eat when you are seriously hungry' which means I do have days when I eat &lt;1000 kcal which I know is frowned upon, but oh well, as long as I don't feel like I'm going to bed hungry, that's fine with me. With this, I'm aiming for a 500 kcal daily deficit *on average*.I have some rules I'd like to track in the coming month:1. When feeling hungry, drink half a litre of water, diet soda, or super low kcal lemonade. 2. If still hungry after 20 minutes, eat an apple.3. If still hungry after 20 minutes, eat a meal. 5. Always take the stairs down (I live 5 high), always take the stairs up when wearing flats and casual clothes. Aim for doing this at least once a day.6. Go to the grocery store by bike daily, and if time allows, go to the store thats 20 minutes away, instead of 10 minutes.7. Take a backpack to the store for groceries, and take the stairs up while carrying the additional 5 kg of groceries to make yourself realize what an amount of unnecessary additional weight you are carrying around daily and how this weight is unnecessary impacting your life and health. 8. Clean my house more, find excuses to do additional store runs, whatever, I don't care, just be more active and start moving more often. Yeah. Thats about it.|||I'm going to comment based on my own development from teenager throughout adulthood. Man, I was an awful bitch looking back. Anyway, two things stick out for me:Arrogance - looking back I realized I was super arrogant, especially regarding my skills, abilities and intelligence. Thoughts like 'Oh my fucking god, how can anybody be so fucking STUPID!' came to mind often, and it would make me feel better for being simply being superior and I could honesty despise those people I thought of as stupid and inferior. I don't think this anymore, I see that there is also a lot of value in being good in non traditional academic things, such as being very good with people and children or having the patience and heart to deal with the sick and elderly on a daily basis. There is a lot of value and worth to be found everywhere. That being said, I still think I'm better in a lot of things than most people, and I think I dare say out loud that I'm confident now I'm *objectively* better in those things than a lot of people. And it still makes me feel really good knowing I'm good at those things, I simply lost the feeling that *unless* somebody is good at those same things, they must suck. Empathy and moral compass - I was an emotional mess for the longest time into early adulthood. I had a way bigger problem empathizing with people and situations compared to other teens my age. I would rationalize everything and that made it ok in my book. But the thing is, once you are forced to look at the fundamental grounds on which your rationalization is based, you realize it comes back to ethics.. it comes down to the fact that I honestly can't find objective value or goals to life. I still relate a lot to Nietzsche's nihilism. I'm still struggling with developing my ethical side to be honest, wondering if I ever will.. My empathic side is growing a lot faster, due to chronic illness I had to face and several other big ilness related problems in my family. I am currently really trying to fill in my ethical side by being empathic instead of basic my ethics on core principles. Some kind of 'don't do unto others' and considering the effect of my decisions on others, instead of truly having a feeling of what is truly good and what is evil, because really, I feel only the extremes are back and white, everything in between is a big fat gray area. Maybe some comparison to fictional characters?Badly developed teenage TYPE_MENTION: Azula from Avatar the last Airbender.TYPE_MENTION without a set ethical principle: Magneto from the X-Men.|||And this is exactly where I kind of draw the line. You are giving an example in which you use MBTI to explain why a certain social interaction happened. I disagree with that use of MBTI completely. Another user just commented that he/she also has an TYPE_MENTION mother and their relationship is absolutely beautiful. Type does not determine personality or personal compatibility. And that's the whole point, MBTI offers a tool on structures thinking patterns and modes of experiencing the world, but every person is still their own person and every person, regardless of type can be an absolute sociopathic moster.|||Trilingual kid here. ^ is absolutely right. One thing though: both parents need to speak each other's language as well to make this work, because ideally you'll be able to sit at the dinner table where both parents can speak their own language and can actually hold a properly shared discussion. This is especially important once the kid gets older.|||Disclosure: personally I think too many people do not think about why they want children, and just do so 'because that's what you are supposed to do'. This makes me incredibly angry for the sake of those children. So if I seem a bit harsh in my comment, don't take it too personal.I think anyone who would choose children for the right reasons and have honestly thought it through why they want children, would not be bothered by the thought of adopting if they couldn't get pregnant themselves. (Because I can actually understand wanting to experience pregnancy if you are on the baby train to begin with.)I guess that would be my advice.. think about why you want children (especially a big family like you talked about in your post) to begin with. I read in your comments you two decided against adoption because of cost and time issues.. But frankly, I think both of these are god awful reason to say no to adoption in the grand scheme of things as both the time and money spend on an adoption will only be a fraction of the time and money spend on raising a child. This makes me honestly wonder whether you and your husband have a good reason for wanting children at all.... Maybe that's where the doubt you are feeling now is coming from in the first place as well.|||I met by SO during my first week at university when I was 18 and he was 23. I'm 22 now, still together. For me: I don't do casual dating. I feel *very* uncomfortable hooking up and being physical with people I don't know. And yes, for me, a relationship *needs* to have a good long term outlook from the very start, because if I already know we wouldn't be compatible in 5 or 10 years, why even try for 1? Just to be able to have someone around to fuck and not feel lonely, while you know it will cause a heartbreak in the end? I couldn't care less really for those kind of relationships. Your questions are very valid and all those questions are the kind of questions I discussed thoroughly with my SO during our first year and we still talk a lot about it now. You deal with those circumstances by being open in your communication with one another and start planning your long term lives together and compromise. My SO got the opportunity to get an amazing internship abroad that would be super beneficial for his career. I simply told him to go, without hesitation. I'll wait. What's 3/6/9 months on a lifetime? Just today I discussed that we may have an opportunity to live and work together in China for 6-12 months in about 2 years. One of my life long dreams, but my SO hates China. But we compromise and he is up for it if we move back to Europe again for at least a year or two after we are done in China.|||How are your language skills? You have EU citizenship, this will allow you to study at EU tuition fees on the mainland (but not UK, as they also require residence). If you speak French or German fluently, that would be perfect, they have very *very* cheap (almost free) tuition. If not, you might want to consider my University, the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. They offer most of their bachelor degrees in English, at 2k a year in tuition fees.Having EU citizenship will also really help you when you choose this path as it will allows you to work without a visa. You could come over, work some unskilled jobs for a year or so, save money and get a degree. You might also want to research whether either France or Spain has student loan/bursary systems. My country has it, many other EU countries do as well, but I don't know about France or Spain. If they do, it might provide you with the money needed to get an education, even if it means (cheap) loans.|||Germany has jus sanguinis, from your info it seems your mum had her German citizenship at the moment you were born, that makes you a German citizen by descent. This should be easy enough to proof if you have your mums documents, especially if you happen to have on of her old passports which was valid when you were born. Although Romania also has jus sanguinis, you can't apply for citizenship through this right as your mother wasn't Romanian at the time of your birth. You need to apply through another route: repatriation. It's a different part of the nationality law.Although in the case of USA/Germany/Romania you probably won't have any problems luckily, you need to check the following carefully: Practically all countries allow dual citizenship *by birth*, but many countries do not allow dual citizenship if the additional citizenship is acquired otherwise. If a citizen of such a countries acquired a new citizenship, they loose their old one. So in the case of Romanian repatriation you need to check the laws of the other countries carefully whether they'd allow it without having to renounce citizenship of that country.|||To your wife however you might sound exactly the same about the country she was born in and loves. It makes you react hostile towards the person who posted it, no wonder your wife is reacting hostile towards you.|||As an egalitarian woman, I wish more men understood this. This little piece of text is the core of everything that is wrong with society when it comes to women's rights and equality. The constant, subtle fear. The fear of being raped, the fear of being harassed, the fear of not being taken seriously, and the fear of ruining someone's live by simply standing up for yourself when calling out a man on his behaviour.There are many issues with men's rights and equality that I also fight for, but I think the core of those problems is more related to societies value system and how men are pushed to be 'masculine'. These issues are just as serious, but they are different in how they are experienced opposed to women's issues. It's not about the catcalling. It's about being afraid to walk down the street.|||I expect most young people to have basic google skills, and google does a pretty damn good job in indexing reddit.

The university runs a very good Chemistry bachelor programme in English (!) and the university won a Nobel Prize in chemistry this year as well. Tuition is 2k a year, but I believe you can get UK gov funding/loans for tuition. Living expenses are also on the low side compared to UK. There are also a bunch of UK students here already and those who I spoke to are all very happy with their choice. Check the website. It will have some clear info on the required A levels for UK students to enter the chemistry programme. If you qualify you simple apply and you'll be admitted, after that you simply come over and that will be everything.The only issue is: what happens with brexit?

They seriously fit with anything and are actually super conservative, while still giving an interesting silhouette of vintage 50s.|||Ok. So, then you have two options: quit now, ending the programme, or continue a year, and probably ending the programme after that year, unless you are confident you will be able to find someone who will take over.Either way, I think my earlier point stands. Your job now as leader is to find a way to transition responsibility of the project to other people. Either as part of a uni run programme or by finding students who will take over.I really recommend doing the uni route though. I'm biased though, because I founded my own women in STEM mentoring programme also at a uni with an incredibly strong student community, for which I did successfully found collaborations with faculty members and deans. Frankly. For me *personally* it wouldn't have been worth my time if I couldnt guarantee continuation of the project after I'd leave.|||1200 is a lot.

I'm the same, really, and my SO is currently struggling with a mix of depression and anxiety. Luckily he found a good psychiatrist who referred him to a hospital psychologist for therapy. The psychologist was great, I went with him to meet her and everything. When she started talking about treatments and such, I asked her whether she'd have some extra information for me as well so I could read up and help my SO through treatment. She looked me dead in the eye and said: \\\"No, I will not give you extra information, not because you don't mean well, but because your SO needs to do this all on his own because if you help him through treatment, after treatment you'll still be his crutch and that will leave him dependent on your support and care. As much as you mean well, it will not help your SO.\\\" As the person in our relationship who is more the leader type who keeps everything in order and marches us forward in life...

I was still in recovery during his birthday last year and he planned his birthday according to what I was capable of so we could celebrate his birthday together, even if that meant having fewer of his friends over to our home for a shorter period of time.

Every single time, I needed heavy pain medication (lot's of oxy's) to cope with the pain. Heavy pain medication makes you feel absolutely black out drunk, without the dizziness and the world spinning around you. You can't make coherent thoughts, much less speak coherently. It's like your head is super heavy and you can barely control your body enough to lift any limbs. Like I said: as if you are black out drunk. Your number one concern right now should be for your boyfriend, not your own feelings. You can discuss this when he's patched up again, but really, do you really feel *this* is the right time to discuss *you* feeling uncomfortable? Also, her behaviour might really not be anything to concern yourself about. When I'm home alone with my SO, we are naked 90% of the time. When I was a kid still living at home, I would often just wear underwear and a tanktop around the house, or just cover myself with a towel after I just took a shower. When I have close friends over (both male and females) and I'm having a lazy sunday, I still only wear some shorts and a tank top. And if they are over and I'm having a shower, I really couldn't care less if they went into the bathroom if they needed to use the toilet and saw me naked.

For example, you wouldn't say that Harvard University offers the same level of education as some random state university. Both however would give you a bachelor/master degree. Also, there is less differentiation on academic capabilities in high school, which becomes even more apparent if you think about AP classes which might already give you some college credits. This is also why SAT is needed when selecting students for your university. In Europe, there is very little selection or need for things like SAT. Selection is done way earlier, in my country at 12 years old right before kids start with high school. If you possess the right level of high school diploma, than, per definition, you are capable enough to enter any university. You don't need to get selected because you already are. About 15-20% of the population gets this highest type of high school diploma, and about 20-25% gets a mid-level high school diploma which allows access to schools of applied science. This brings us to the 40% of tertiary degree holders you qouted in your links above.I'm not saying that the EU universities are all Harvards, that's ridiculous of course, but what I am saying is that there is a lot less range in difficulty and quality across universities. If you get a bachelor diploma from university X than you'll in general be allowed into a follow up masters programme at other university without many restrictions or heavy admissions procedures because there educational level a specific diploma entails is heavily regulated. This is the main difference between the US and the EU, for example many US colleges/unis would be considered schools of applied science over here for example, and not university level, even though they issue bachelor degrees. I have a good example of this. Several of my family members got into US colleges, they however all had mid-level high school diplomas and would in no way be able to attend university in the Netherlands. When they got back to the Netherlands and sought additional Dutch university level education based on their US college diplomas they were denied, because the government stated that their college diplomas equaled a school of applied science diploma, not a university diploma.This is important for OP, as in OPs case, it is more important to figure out if the German universities recognize his bachelor diploma as equal to German university bachelor diplomas. If this is true, than grade transcripts will matter a lot less then they would in the US if you apply for a graduate programme at another university.|||Not everybody on r/FI is a US national though. ;) I'm certain not one, so IRA's are not in the picture for me and other retirement savings plans in my country are government mandated and paid for by my employer entirely.|||Ok, so the problem is both not knowing what to expect from the weather and not knowing what exactly will be the dress code during the separete events during the day..I think the dress + cardigan would be fine during the day. Will you be wearing tighta with that dress? Maybe for the evening you could carry some tights for when it gets cold. Something to switch out for your cardigan may also come in handy. Maybe a nice, classy blazer or something? If suddenly you find yourself underdressed a blazer can help, and most likely will keep you quite a bit warmer than a cardigan. Also, maybe carry a nice silky scarf, both for weather adjustments and fitting in if needed.|||Some things I noticed as I worked together with a *lot* of faculty on all different levels, up to the faculty board/dean etc. I don't think there is a lot of *active* sexism going on.. but simply a lack of consideration ingrained in the older male generation of faculty staff. For example, when I was a the student member of the faculty board, we faced a situation where one of the research institutes proposed a short list of candidates to take place on the institute board. These were all men. Now, our male dean is *very* conscious about gender equality and simple went back to the director of that institute and asked them: why aren't there any women of your short list, because female professors x, y and z would in my opinion be just as senior and qualified as male professors a, b and c on your shortlist. It was at that moment when the institute figured: Fuck. We have a subconscious pro-male bias going on. They adjusted their short list, and there are now a few woman on the institute board. It was certainly not an active act against gender equality, or against the women in their institute.Being young (early 20s) and having dealt with current senior leaders of 50+ years and young future leaders of my age, I notice that the male future leaders are very conscious about gender equality and generally actively think about and support gender equality. Also, I notice the male future leaders have a lot less trouble in understanding and interpreting typical 'female speech' compared to male senior leaders. The senior leaders simply have a life time of social conditioning behind them that's not easily rewired.. they might want to change, but it is very, very difficult to them.I truly believe that once the current generation of male(!) future leaders gets through into management, we will see a lot of progress towards better gender equality outcomes, and I truly believe the new generation of now baby girls and boys will be in a far better position regarding this once they hit our age. I'm specifically saying male future leaders, because yes, we - the 20 or 30 somethings females - will still have an issue getting through in management, because new management will be chosen by the current senior management who are generally still biased and will have an easier time selecting males over females for new management positions. But once the men in senior management will have less of an ingrained, social bias against women.. it will be easier and more natural to achieve a harmonious, gender equal organization.|||European as well, and I live in a city where the university is a big part of city life. (LOT's of students!)Many people wear hoodies and other university gear in my city. Just like any other hoodie. They are nice and comfy and also show some pride for your university. Nobody bats an eye either. But of course, they're still hoodies, so you wouldn't wear them to any place you wouldn't really wear a hoodie.|||Same. At moments of intense stess I go into hyper rational mode, as in: shit just hit the fan, I need to get a grip on the situation RIGHT NOW. It's only later once the immediate stress backs down I get awfully emotional, especially at night when I'm in bed or in the shower, when it's quiet and my mind gets a spare moment to drift away. That's when I cry.. alone, preferably. I do talk a lot about my emotions and feelings, especially to my SO, but only after I cried. After I'm done getting the emotions out on my own, I'll go to my SO and tell him I'm feeling like crap and need to talk.|||I have multiple mentors, but the thing is, I haven't actually asked any of my mentors to 'be my mentor' so to say. It's a type of relationship, like you don't ask your dad to be your dad either. I know you're a guy, but Sheryl Sandberg in her book Lean In has some really good chapters on this. My major mentors are also women of different ages. I get a lot of good feedback from my eldest mentor, a kick ass lady approaching 60 who's seen it all, been through it all. We often have lunch together, where we talk business, life and everything else really. Honestly, I can call her for any kind of favour I'd might need and she'll help me with it. Talking about what I've learned from them: I am childfree.. which is difficult for an ambitious women as society tends to look down at you both for not wanting children Ã¡nd being ambitious. Most of my female mentors are also childfree. They show me I am making the right choice for me and this is the life that will make me happy.I think, anyone who inspired you and you feel a connection with, in the sense that both are willing to open up a bit more personally to one another, could be a mentor. It's not a relationship you can force or 'claim'.|||This doesn't go for all men luckily (like most CF men for example), but I think in general men do not realize how much time it costs to raise children. My guess is that most men are still (subconsciously) affected by traditional gender roles in which they take on far less workload in raising the kid, so they actually don't realize that, no, actually, there *won't* be any time left.|||Thanks for the link, your post gave me quite a few extra notebooks/shops to check out.|||If you want to come the NL you should know that a MSc will be necessary if you want a PhD position.|||I have two coats, a spring/summer and a winter coat.

You can't begin to imagine how often he has expressed the same worries in the exact same words as you are using to me.I am going to tell you something about my feelings for my SO, which are probably the same for your SO. You are not going to believe what I say, you  don't have to. You only have to trust my words and with that, trust your own SO. I always tell my SO: if you find yourself in a bad space during which you *know* you can't trust your own mind, put all your faith and trust in me, and let that pull you through.Anyway: I love my SO. I love every single thing about him. And although I hate the fact he's hurting, and of course wish he wasn't, I still love him, despite the voices in the back of his head who whisper all those nasty things. I love him because of the strength and determination he has to get his butt to his psych every time and again. I love him because he is a fighter and every day he makes the effort to get a bit better. I love him for the understanding he has of his own personality, for he knows he's not perfect.

The thing is, I'm saying get the passport regardless is because it's valuable if you for example ever happen to travel abroad to other countries and you get in trouble. A EU passport allows you to step into any EU embassy and they are required to help you. Also. If you want children of your own, it will make the process a lot easier if you can step into a Croatian embassy and say: this is my kid, here's my passport and my kids birth certificate, give me a Croatian passport for my kid as well. Sure with just citizenship papers you'd be able to this as well, but a passport makes everything so much easier.|||I like backing up my claims with data, so following your post, I looked up if I could find any. Here's [(pdf)](https://www.epnuffic.nl/en/publications/find-a-publication/grading-systems-in-the-netherlands-the-united-states-and-the-united-kingdom.pdf) a very short English summary of 'Nuffic' our national organization that compares school and grading systems word wide to the Dutch system to help schools and universities with their admission processes and get official transcripts of Dutch diploma's for applications to foreign universities. They have the more thorough report available in which they actually show their statistical analysis, but that one's only available in Dutch.They explain exactly why the one on one reasoning of A+ = 10, A = 9 etc does not hold.Based on their statistics, an A+ equals an 8.5/10 or higher, an A a 7.5/10 or higher. And the higher grades of 9s and 10s are statistically even given out less then I expected, which comes as a surprise even to me. This is why many universities readjust grades of Dutch students going to America to lower grades, because else they are overvalued.|||Netherlands, 0 to 10 point scale. Passing grade is a 5.5. This however is not a percentage scale or 'graded on a curve'. If you want a 10/10, your work needs to be absolutely perfect, as in not a single thing you could have done better. Needless to say: such grades are almost never given and many professors refuse to give a 10 on principle. I usually see the US 4.0 GPA compared to a 8-8.5 grade at our universities.|||The thing is as an employer you either want a lab analyst who you hire to do the actual - often standard - lab work and you hire a scientifically trained researcher for their expertise and innovation. Now, when looking at the academic landscape you'll see to types of higher education: university and applied education. For example, a Chemist trained at a applied sciences educational institute will be trained over the course of 4 years to do lab work and will spend *loads* of his/her time studying in the lab, actually doing lab work. A chemist at university level will during their bachelors of three year only spend about 6-8 months in total in a lab (including basic lab practicals) and another year during their masters. That's why bachelor degrees aren't that popular: you don't have the specialized knowledge to be hired as an expert, but you won't higher a bachelor university student for lab work either because there are people with applied degrees who simply know how to do that job better, because they were *trained* to do those jobs.|||Like all the others said, I think it is very unreasonable for you to expect that you'll fiance will 'simply pay off *your* loans'.But I do have a suggestion. Maybe you can talk to you fiance about her offering you a loan (nicely documented and signed) for the full amount of your debt, but at a *very* low interest rate and pay back schedule you both agree on so your loans are less of some kind of guillotine hanging over your head and more manageable. Maybe this will make you feel supported and having both of you work toward a shared goal, with still taking into account your fiance's wishes to keep finances strictly separate.|||How are your funds? If you want to get into Europe you should do so through getting a masters in your neuroscience field. The other option is fo get a job and have your employer get you a visa,  but that's not a realistic option wih only a bachelors degree. However,  if you get your neuroscience master you'll have pretty good chances of finding a job over here and actually be able to stay.|||Dutch, not German, but I've noticed in my country it should be quite easy to get in and if you don't have a qualifying diploma you can take a - as we call it - switch year which takes anywhere from 3 tot 18 months to get all the undergraduate course credits you need. German and Dutch education systems are similar, maybe they offer the same thing.One think I should caution you about: American uni's follow the college system, we don't have that over here. Over here you choose your major immediately when you start studying (hell, you even start specializing earlier during high school when you're about 14/15), so you have had 3 full time major bachelor years before you start your master. My specific uni has a few masters that are really high up there in ranking etc and attract people from top uni's all over the world and you wouldn't know how often I heard professors say: 'I never realised those students from MIT/Stanford/whatever knew so little compared to European students...'Doesn't mean the level is too high for US students, because these students complete the programme just fine, it just takes them some extra effort to get on the same knowledge level as European students.|||Many states in the US has *a lot* of ways to convict SO's husband for abusive based on that video, even if the 'abused' is outright against the abuse claims and says it was fully consensual.

It's not like the US over here, you need to choose your study (for example .. sociology or mechanical engineering) and apply for that specific study and you're busy doing that subject from day 1.

The problem that you have is that the visa category that you would use (called \\\"H1-B\\\") is oversubscribed. There are only 65,000 visas given annually, but there are about three times that amount of applicants.So, even if you found a job and your employer was willing to sponsor you, your chances are not favorable. It's about a one-in-three chance.(There's a related problem is that the government takes applications on a first-come, first-serve basis, so you have to apply at the beginning of April for visas that start in September. So you'd have to get your job offer very soon to apply for this year... otherwise the next application period is in April 2017 for visas valid in September 2017.)If you don't want to play that game, here are your other options:Find a US employer with an office in Switzerland. (I know for a fact that Google has an office there, and I'm sure some other major employers do too.) After one year in that office, you can apply for an L1 (internal transfer) visa to the United States if your employer will agree to transfer you to the USA. There is no quota on this type of visa. However, it is not an immigrant visa, so if you change employers or lose your job, you have to leave the country. There is no direct path from an L1 to permanent residency (aka, \\\"green card\\\"). You can enter on an L1 and then petition to change to H1-B, but you're the quota problem above will still be an issue. But there is no time limit on an L1 as long as you stay with the same employer, so you can keep trying to get the H1-B every year until you are successful.Obtain a master's degree in Computer Science from a United States university. Then you can qualify for special treatment in the H1-B program, which reserves an additional 20,000 visas for people who receive advanced degrees from universities in the United States. (It must be in the USA: getting a Swiss master's doesn't help you in this case.)Apply for the diversity visa. (aka, \\\"green card lottery.\\\") The chance isn't high, but your chance is higher than most other applicants from Russia, China, etc., because the quota for these visas is set per country, and not many people from Switzerland apply. Swiss are, after all, mostly content to stay in Switzerland.Source: I was a hiring manager in a large Silicon Valley company for many years.|||Thank you!|||To me this looks exactly like the psychology (and other social science) girls would wear.

Especially in this case when its essentially a cross department power struggle with OP caught in the middle.

Many TYPE_MENTION however lack the natural ability to simply even *try* to cope, due to being out of touch with our inner emotional world. It's probably even *more* important for TYPE_MENTION do have professional guidance when dealing with trauma, simply because most of us still need to learn the basics, for which there is no mental space and opportunity to do so on your own if you are in the middle of dealing with a trauma'. This woman actually decided to *continue* with professional therapy even after the immediate trauma was taken care of, simply to focus on building the emotional skill sets, so that when (and it will!) a next traumatic situation occurs, she will be better equipped to take care of herself.Why I am posting this?

Anyway, in Europe, when you to university, you study for a specific degree from day 1. So if you want to be a lawyer you start with a bachelor in Law and you do a master in Law as your specialisation. With the exception of a very few specific fields, doing a master really isn't optional if you want a job. For example, in my country, if you want to study law your 'passing the bar exam' equivalent is tied to your masters degree.Also, you can't switch subjects. If you want to do a master is Law the entry requirement is a bachelor in Law. About competiveness: most EU countries have some kind of tiered high school system and getting the HS diploma from the right tier with the right courses will grant you entry to certain uni degrees. Unlike the US, students usually dont have to compete, but simply need to match entry requirements. There are usually a few exceptions for very popular degrees like Medicine. You have a bunch of AP classes, that's a very good start! I think you'll find your scores to be high enough for most degrees. One issue: language. If you go to the UK there's no problem of course, but usually bachelor degrees in the mainland are in their native language, and only master degrees are in English. With your interest in international law, you might be in luck though, in terms of finding mainland uni's who offer this bachelor in English.Anyway, like always, I also like to draw some attention to my home uni: University of Groningen in the Netherlands. The UG is rather special in the sense that they position themselves as an international university and offer the majority of their bachelor degrees in English. There is also a very strong international vibe and community in my city. Google them and have a look if you're interested.

Yet they only *praised* hard work. They never pushed me, never told me what to do or what not to do. They told me from a very young age 'we'e not going to tell you what to do, you are your own person and you need to decide that for yourself. No 'do your homework', no checking bed times, and if I at 14 told them I wanted to go party with my 16-17 year old friend and drink alcohol, they let me.If they worried about me, they'd come sit with me and have an adult, rational discussion in which they expressed their point of view. But they'd never be mad if I chose differently. They only expected one thing of me: work hard. It didn't matter on what topic (though they'd definitily prefer me to excel academically), but hard work got me praise, slacking off got me disappointment.Anyway, I grew up in extreme freedom, in which help and guidance was only there when asked for, and which made sure that I was growing up into an adult who thinks for herself and follows only the decisions she came up with herself after thorough considering all the options.The thing is, I'm sure it influenced me, however, this parenting style also really *fit* me, even at a young age. So maybe my character / personality also influenced the parenting style of my parents.|||I'm going for the 'Im a nihilist' trope. Frankly, I find nihilism to be quite a soothing outlook on life, because without intrinsic purpose, everything and anything goes and life is totally malleable. If you want to be happy, you decide to be happy. Barring mental illness, I truly believe you have a lot of control over how you emotionally react to a situation and how you steer your emotional well-being. You can make the conscious choice to see the good of the situation and find something to laugh about. Nothing is stopping you, as there are no prerequisites for any path you choose in life. No 'grand scheme of things', no purpose that tells you that only when you achieved X you'll be happy, no invisible deterministic hands that dictates when you can and cannot be happy.. nope. Just you and a life that has been given to you without reason and purpose, so do with it what ever you see fit. You only have yourself to blame if you're not satisfied with it.|||I'll copy paste one of my comments from another post somewhere on how difficult paternity leave is:The same applies to this subreddit.No, we childfree people shouldn't get extra time off because maternity leave exists. Frankly, maternity leave is nothing more than medical leave, which childfree people *do* get even if it is a voluntary procedure.Arguing we should get extra leave because someone got maternity leave is the same as someone saying they want extra leave because a coworker got time of for their sterilisation. It actually *is* a level playing field.This is where my quoted comment comes into play. I believe most of the users here as US based, and frankly, it is not maternity leave you people are angry about, it is the lack of social security and government mandated paid leave. The reason many CF people are angry specifically about maternity leave is because this is one of the things that is regulated, while many things that should are not. Be happy maternity (read: medical leave) exists and use that precedent to start the discussion on what more regulations and employee protections should be in place.|||Yes! Perception of female achievement is *definitely* at play! I do not deny that at all. That's why I called it a delicate topic, simply because there are many sides to this issue, sides that indeed form a system in which women who *should* get recognition, but didn't, but also reasons that make women less qualified to get the highest of highest recognition due to societal forces.I always make it a point of bringing up this various perspectives, simply to show how deep rooted this problem is and how we need to improve many facets of our society to achieve equality. I point it out, because I'm sick and fed up with always hearing the 'hurr, durr, patriarchy' argument which does not *help* the cause of equality at all. That being said, I get that there are many notable women who could have been/should have been in the race.. however, I also acknowledge that there are probably also a lot of male scientists who made just as amazing discoveries and also pushed science forward, who *also* didn't get the prize. I am certain that the Nobel prize committee also realizes their lack of gender diversity, and is truly applying some self reflection to see whether there is a bias going on. Maybe I am an optimist, but I belief these men in the committee are truly trying to be as fair and equal as they can. That would be my message to all of us as well: to apply self reflection to catch gender biases. God knows that even I as an egalitarian woman catch myself too often in being biased against women because of how society unconsciously formed my belief system.|||I think it is good to note that most (European) countries that have a system of a fully or very heavily subsidized tertiary education, also have a system in place where not every student will be able to enroll at universities. For example, my country has a tiered high school system, based on an intelligence test taken when children are about 12 years old. There are three tiers, a vocational tier (4 years), an intermediate tier (5 years) and a pre-university tier (6 years). Only the last one will allow you entry to a university. The other two will will get you into a vocational school and a school of applied sciences.  Percentage wise the students population is divided something like 50/30/20 over these three tiers. (Naturally movement between tiers is possible depending on study results!)The thing is, each tertiary type of education answers a specific demand in society and actually a lot of university schooled people are unable to find jobs, while people with vocational or applied science degrees do find jobs. I see the following example often when discussing degrees in /r/IWantOut. People with a US BSc Chemistry (uni level) degree who want to know their job perspectives in western Europe. Answers: not that good, because the only thing BSc Chemistry students would be up to would be lab analyst/technician type of jobs, but guess what, we have students of applied sciences who are **trained** to be lab technicians so they are favoured way over university schooled students. Having such a tiered system makes sure you don't 'just need a degree' to get a job, while still providing accessible education to all.|||I like this comparison. On top of that: I think the difference in 'leap' sizes (because, let's face it, TYPE_MENTION have some end of the universe timeline thinking going on, we don't) is simply something society can't accommodate well and as such, is considered (in terms of money etc) as 'less valuable'. TYPE_MENTION's bridge the gap many other types can't jump, but of which those other types can actually see the other side of the gap of. People would call the TYPE_MENTION 'inspired' and 'visionairy', while TYPE_MENTION's gap is *so* wide, many types simply can't even begin to see where the TYPE_MENTION is going.|||Second in Rome. Power and influence =/= title and official position. Play the game right, and everyone knows who's *actually* the boss.|||Then please, start organizing events for boys to help them get ahead as well! At least from me you'll get the same amount of praise I am giving the OP for his initiatives. Like I said to the OP: he's changing the world, one dad and one daughter at the time. You can also be the one to change the world if it is something you care about, in this case one dad and one son at the time.|||Considering you have French citizenship as well, you also qualify for the lower EU tuition fees on the mainland (but not the islands as they require EU residency). This means your options suddenly grow a lot for low tuition fees. For example, I'm Dutch and our tuition fees are 2k a year, which os doable. The business school at my uni is also AACSB (which  is an American accreditation) accredited and has one of the strongest marketing master degrees of Europe. This might also be interesting for you if you ever decide to get back to the US. Practically all marketing masters degrees in Europe will also be taught in English so that's a bonus as well.|||Another reason why I feel very strongly about the age brackets and not asking the 'obvious choice' of well known female senior staff members who are closer to the end of their career then at the beginning. Your much more likely to think 'yeah, I should be able to guide 3 PhD students and write a 250k grant proposal' then to think 'I'm able to run a group of 15 PhDs, 4 post docs, get research grants of 2 mil and write 10+ papers a year'.|||you could probably do a master like this: https://www.geographie.hu-berlin.de/en/studies/study-programs/master-degree-programs/master-of-scienceI'd suggest you look up which universities berlin has, and do some google searches like '(name uni) geographie bachelor' and use google translate to look at bachelor information pages in an effort to find something about further studies and which masters follow after a bachelor in geography at that uni. You'd most likely get entry to the same masters, if your diploma is of a recognized US uni.|||Maybe something like... 'Ok, good luck.' which can totally be interpreted both ways.|||Yep, I have the same, but not with internships but with my board years. (Something typically Dutch, as we have *a lot* of professional 100% student run organizations - many of which have x00k budgets, some even millions - and many companies require board years to make you a good candidate).You realize how boring and bland simply studying is. It's just acquiring knowledge, but nothing more, it doesn't help you in any way in your personal development. Anyway, my advise would be to actually take up projects you like to do, either your own or join clubs or organizations and put a decent amount of hours in those. This helped for me, I know put in 15+ hours a week in projects and this makes me happy and enthusiastic about engineering in general, which helps me to bring up some enthusiasm for my bland studies as well. Bonus points: this will also help you getting even better internships next year!|||This.. this is what I do... Damn. Reading it like this makes me realize how I'm really an evil, manipulative bitch when it comes to my flavour of social engineering. It does get me what I want though.|||My SO doesn't necessarily care about cleanliness. I mean, he's not a pig, but he simply doesn't 'see' the mess as he describes it. However, he does not mind doing housework. If however I'd ask him to 'remember to put your clothes away in the bedroom' he would simply forget, because he doesn't 'see' the mess. If however I'd say \\\"I'm going to do laundry in about 15 minutes, could you do the dishes and vacuum?\\\" or even \\\"I'm going out with the girls tonight, could you make sure the laundry is taken in before I get home?\\\" he'd be like 'Sure! No problem!' simply because he's given a concrete task and a timeline for doing that task. He may not see it himself, but he was just told the mess exists and he will look for it and clean it. Maybe a similar approach works for you.|||The real extraverts actually get energy from socializing. That's why the extreme extraverts are so loud and obnoxious, they're social interaction junkies craving for a new hit.|||Please, *please* post this in legal advice subreddits OP! You'll never know what might be possible in your situation to get this solved and get full custody etc, simply because you lack knowledge.|||It depends. The first question to ask yourself is why you want a mentor and what do you expect to get from your mentor-mentee relationship? I have collected several mentors over the past years. These relationships grew rather naturally for me, which they did because I somehow instinctively new what I expected/wanted from each of them, and I acted accordingly to make the relationship grow that way. The trick is: if you have to ask the person to be your mentor, you're doing it wrong. It's not something you can randomly put a sticker on. It's not something you 'ask for' to happen. Mentoring someone/being someones mentee is just a type of relationship like many others, which takes effort to establish and need to be nourished by both persons.|||I feel like my COGFUNC_MENTION is quite obviously present, but it's a hard process to actually pin point and put words. As an TYPE_MENTION, I do feel I can't just readily 'access' my COGFUNC_MENTION. It's always triggered by my COGFUNC_MENTION. My COGFUNC_MENTION is some kind of constant scanner function, that looks at anything, anyone at anytime to see whether there are inconsistencies, whether things can be optimized, whether there is room for improvement or whether somehow, sometime a situation gives room for new opportunities.My COGFUNC_MENTION is some kind of huge spiderweb in my brain that stores and connects all these COGFUNC_MENTION triggers. Somehow - this is where it becomes fuzzy - my brain is making all kinds of connections and relationships between this triggers. From the sum of the parts emerges a greater whole, that gives me a certain vision of how I see the future of my own life, the company I work for, etc, etc.This gives rise to a certain looping effect, as any *new* COGFUNC_MENTION trigger is then immediately judged against the spiderweb of connections and the vision that comes from it, to give it a place, or to see whether there are synergies between earlier COGFUNC_MENTION triggers. It is during these train of thoughts I notice my COGFUNC_MENTION the most. The moments where a new COGFUNC_MENTION trigger someone perfectly falls into place and finds either - seemingly - totally unrelated synergies that improve the overall spiderweb significantly, or a new piece of info that radically moves the spiderweb into a new directions. It's these moments when my mind goes silent and I tell myself: '.... omg. shit. this is amazing.'It's also these moments that give me the energy to keep going on, and on, and on. I notice I quickly get bored and unmotivated to do anything if I don't have this process continuously running.|||Easiest way will always be through student visas. Why not study in Germany to begin with?|||No, but this also is depending on local laws. For example, in my country, any child born in a marriage, the father automatically gains parental rights when the child is born, even if the child is not his. In this case the mother cant decide on her own to give up the child for adoption. You could of course come up with a situation where the mother actively works towards a situation that the father is not aware of the fact that he has a child and therefor will not be given his rights, however, every decent child services agency will always try to track the father before finding adoptive parents|||Start asking lecturers whether they have open positions for you to teach undergrad students as a student assistant. They use *a lot* of TA's in the CS/AI undergrad courses and it pays really well (~2300 a month full time equivalent). If you want more info, start asking around with the Dutch students who also did their undergrad in Groningen and who have this 'vibe' of just being overall very present within the programme, those are usually the ones who teach a lot in undergrad. Also, lot's of CS master students take up part time jobs at dev companies and simply prolong their studies over 3 years or so, like, take 10 ECTS instead of 15 each term. These jobs are also very lucrative. In terms of employability, the CS degree will get you way farther than a business/finance/econ degree anyway, considering there is a *big* shortage of IT people. Anyway, both being a TA and working for local dev companies are usually very international friendly, so not speaking Dutch won't be an issue.|||Darling, one question: assuming you two are sexually active, what type of birth control are you using?*Please* tell me you are using condoms which she does not have access to.

Until I met my partner who questioned me on how that idea was reconciable with my passions: traveling the world, living on all continents at least once in my life, having an amazing career which will take 50-60 hours/week. I figured the joy I'd get from those experiences would by far outweigh children. I believe it's something Oprah once said. \\\"If I'd had children they'd resent me, because something in my life would have to suffer for it, and it would be them and not my career.\\\"|||Ik leen vrij veel aangezien ik geen financiele steun krijg van m'n ouders, maar ik doe hetzelfde met het restje lening wat overblijft iedere maand.

This would mean also being able to eventually get an education and a job in the local language. You *will* need C-level proficiency for this.Universities require a minimum B2 proficiency to be enrolled for a degree taught in the local language, however, I highly discourage anyone who has anything below B2+ almost going on C1 to apply at a foreign university degree, because you'll have a *really* bad time. To give some perspective: at B2 you should be able to read the first couple of Harry Potter books any trouble whatsoever and the later books with maybe a bit of trouble. Good luck reading highly specialized academic literature at B2.Same for having a job that is in any wau requiring you to write stuff down in the target language (which if you think of it, are almost all jobs above simple manual labour). At B2 you should have no problems writing short simple paragraphs on day to day topics, for example, back at school when I was studying German for my B2 writing test I had to write 500 words about how my holidays went to a friend back home. This letter would only include simple grammatical structures, barely any sentence longer then maybe 15-20 words. Even this would not be without major grammatical and stylistic errors. If you want a job in which you need to write reports on which other people depend, C1 is also the minimum.|||If you have any questions regarding the University of Groningen, don't hesitate to PM me. I'm more than happy to answer your questions and help where possible. If you're really interested and want to visit Groningen and the university this summer when you're in the Netherlands, also shoot me a PM, I'll give you and your family a tour (or find someone else to do so). (It's a great city anyway to visit for a day or 2 day trip.)|||In that case, also consider the costs of getting your license in the Netherlands. It will probably be cheaper to do so in your home country so that's something to check. Some estimates: a driving lesson is about 40-50 euros, and on average you'll need between 30 and 40 lessons. Theory exam I maybe 40 euros (which most uni students pass in one try) and the actual driving exam in the end is about 300 euros, which many people have to take twice as they don't pass the first time. So that's also a cost of about 1500 to 2500 euros to take into account.|||Your daughters will look at *both* of you as role models. They may be affected short term by whatever is happening, but they won't be children much longer. They grow up, become adults and will look back at what happened from an adult perspective, not that of a child. The thing is, you can't control whatever your ex is doing, you *can* control how you handle this situation. If your ex won't be a good role model to your daughter, be twice the role model for them instead. If anything, they are all girls, girls often look at their fathers to give them an idea of qualities to look for in their male partners. So, what's there to do for you: *do not* under any circumstance talk badly about their mother. Really. Don't. If you do, your girls will not have a safe place to turn to when they feel the need to talk about their feelings concerning their mum and her behaviour. You need to be safe and trusted, they need to feel you are the one they can communicate with, just the qualities you wan't your daughters to look for in their future partners. Once they do talk to you about her bad behaviour there is nothing wrong with affirming their feelings. However, consider the difference in approaching the following situation.Your teen daughter, emotional and angry as teenagers are: \\\"I hate mum, she didn't take me to piano lessons even though it was raining because she wanted to go out with her boyfriend and the boyfriend told me to just take a bus. I never want to go back to her again!'. You could respond with: 'Yes, I agree with you, your mother is really being a bitch all the time'Or:'How awful, I can image you felt rather sad after that, but you should always remember your mother loves you. What happened afterwards, did you find a way to get to your piano lesson?' Followed up with a discussing on how she should address her feelings with her mum once she sees her again. (This leaves room for you to discretely let your ex know she's being a crap mother of course without your kinds knowing.)Source: my parents divorced when I was a teenager. They did EVERYTHING wrong and because of that I'm still facing the consequences of their crappy parenting. Don't make those same mistakes.|||Maybe that's the difference.

I never accept these.2. Random people with 2-5 degrees of separation. If they don't put anything in their invite or message beforehand about why they want to connect, I usually don't accept these either.3. Recruiters. So many recruiters. I do accept these though, even if they are from companies I have no interest in, because competing recruiters all check each others new connections to find interesting connections themselves. Add 1 recruiter and 2-3 other invites are sure to follow.|||I read this and all I can think is how on earth can a developed first world country be so terrifying to live in that you feel the *need* to carry a gun for self protection. All the things you mention.. I don't even think about encountering situations like those when I leave my home, because it's simply not in the realm of realistic expectations that those things will happen.. I actually don't know *anyone* young or old who's been through those situations. When someone is stabbed with a knife or something, that's something you'd read in the newspapers the day after, that's how rare it is. From that perspective, life would start feeling a lot more dangerous if everybody started to carry guns around, because whenever I'd see a drunk person who'd cat call me I'd be afraid and wonder if he carried while ignoring him and quickly walking past him for example.It does make sense though. If I'd live in a country like Brazil with high crime rates and realistic fear of being raped or robbed I'd want to carry as well, but I never thought the US would be in the same category.|||Do you have a college or university somewhere nearby?

Therefor, my advice would be to go to Europe on a student visa and get your masters degree here. This will also give you a lot of contacts with companies while studying. Once you have your masters degree I do not expect you to have much trouble finding a job, as engineering degrees are valuable, especially if you use those 2 master years (most engineering masters are 2 year by the way!) studying the language of the country you chose. Combining work and study is doable, but only for simple typical student jobs for a few hours a week to net you maybe 200-300 euros extra month. Especially in engineering but also in general it's unusual to combine having a career with studying. Expenses will vary greatly from country to country. There is really no general guideline to be given on that one.|||TYPE_MENTION who has been through enough emotional shit to actually have a decent grasp on COGFUNC_MENTION.|||This has nothing to do with age, but all to do with exposure to the topics. For example, my high school has always given a lot of attention to elections, already from the very start when the students are 12 years old. They'd even organize mock election booths to simulate voting and have many in class discussions on various political topics. An 18 year old who has been actively thinking and discussing major political issues will be far more capable to make an intelligent, informed decision when they are able to actually vote than any adult of 30+ who simply has never been exposed to the topic. This is why populism is so frightening, because these politicians actively prey on the uninformed in society by feeding them half truths and these people lack the knowledge and experience to see through it.One of your main arguments is \\\"we haven't experienced adulthood, thus we can't make informed opinions about it\\\". However, if you are male for example: I hope you are able to *understand* the importance of maternity leave for example (quite a political topic!), even if you have never given birth yourself. The same goes for many, if not all, political topics. You don't need to be dirt poor to understand these people have problems that need to be addressed, and you don't need to be dirt poor to think of solutions for these people. Same with elderly, or very young children (something you have experienced, but most certainly don't remember), or those with either physical or mental handicaps. But also in this regard: it all has to do with exposure, the sheer number of hours someone has been thinking about a certain topic and has trained themselves in considering different point of views and putting themselves in other peoples shoes.|||That actually makes getting out more easy anyway.

You need to provide those girls room to experience typical 'boy stuff' so they can decide for themselves whether they like it in the first place. And when they do, that's when you start to reinforce the girls idea that it's ok to like typical 'boy stuff' and it's ok to tell others to fuck off when they tell you otherwise and stand up for yourself. The problem however is that a lot of girls get those cars yanked from their hands and replaced by dolls before they get the chance to even experience the cars. And when from the very start those young girls hear that they are 'not supposed to like cars', you cannot expect the girl to grow up, still retain interest in STEM and be able to stand up to the adults who pushed her away from STEM to begin with.Note that I'm talking about girls because this post is about daddy/daughter events, but the same argument can be made for boys with more 'feminine interests' such as healthcare in the form of wanting to play with baby born dolls. Similar events in which boys would be able to go to a nursing home and help out with patient care would be just as beneficial as getting girls to a racetrack and build their own car. And *both* those events will require a judgement free space for the same reasons.|||Are you interested in working in CS? Instead of uni, you might consider finding work in that field over in the US and specifically target internationals which can arrange a transfer in a few years or companies that support working abroad in other ways.Do note you'll need to have consistent German residence for at least 8 years (or 6 under some special conditions) to apply for citizenship. And if you do decide to naturalize, also know you'll be required to renounce your current nationality/nationalities.|||You should check the requirements for a Dutch Orientation Year visa.

The thing is: what is the definition of *proper* taxation? Nothing stops the legislative body to change the tax laws to cut down on loopholes which everybody knows and uses. However, they don't and as such are considered fair and legal and using the 'loopholes' *is* proper taxation. How can you blame anyone for following the law? Everybody may use those loopholes and the knowledge is available for everyone, as the law is public, as such no specific group in particular is getting an advantage at the cost of others.|||I was truly shocked when I first saw yellow Big Bird.|||This is why I got a Midori. It's a notebook system which you fill with small paper insert booklets which can be replaced. That way I have several separated notebooks/projects together.|||If I'd pursue one degree, it would be my Chemical Engineering degree, this would take me 5 years assuming no delays. However, to get the type of starters function in the field in my country that will make it easier to climb the ladder, I would need to do a board function during my studies (this is quite cultural thing for us), which I did, so, 1 degree would take me 6 years, assuming no delays or failed courses. My current study plan, which consists of 3 bachelors, 2 masters will take me 7 to 7.5 years. The thing is, I've done quite a bit of research on career paths in the first 5-8 years and spoke with a bunch of recruiters, and I noticed that there are two options when working for industrial internationals in the Netherlands: Either start out as a 'true engineer' at one of the local plants and work yourself up or use the 'business route' through non-engineering degree, usually Economics or BA. However, there are very few engineers with a grasp on or even an interest in business related topics and even less business students who really understand engineering needs. I hope my proven record in both fields will not necessarily make a difference in the first couple of years, but it will once I switch to more multi-disciplinairy areas and teams. I gladly stay put another year or year and a half to get those diplomas. In terms of debt: doing 1 degree and not doing that 1.5 year extra will save me about 10-15k on my total of 70k.|||I do feel like I act a lot on my emotions though. When I'm disappointed in myself, I use that disappointment and anger to give myself a well deserved kick under my own butt to get to work and do better. When I feel like someone wronged me, I plot and scheme to proof them wrong, and again use that feeling to kick my own butt. Same with sadness. Or excitement. And any other feeling to be honest.. my emotions are a large driving factor of what my ambitions are and how I find the work ethics and discipline to achieve those ambitions. No, when I'm sad I don't go 'oh, woe is me' but that doesn't mean that sadness doesn't greatly impact me and I'm some kind of unfeeling robot that's not bothered or influenced by emotions.|||So, I have a shit load of these positions.

If you would actually weigh and count everything in that salad, you might be surprised with how many calories it actually has.|||Just checked, Leiden 11k a year.. quite expensive compared to other Unis. It's actually not that close to English, especially when it comes to grammar, it's closer to German and Norwegian. For example, without any knowledge of Norwegian I can read and understand simple news articles, but someone without any English knowledge wouldn't be able to understand basic English. Personally I found French for example to be closer to English compared to Dutch. Germans at my uni can get a shorter intensive course and get to about B1 in a few months time and to a good B2 within a year. I'm guessing if you're already fluent in German you can do it within a year but with 'just English' it's really rather tough...And again: if you want this, you should absolutely go for it. I'm just telling you not to underestimate learning Dutch (as many people actually do!) and it may be better to expect it would take you longer than a year and in either case it would take a considerable amount of your time.|||I used to be the same like your SO by the way regarding sleep patterns.. my own sleep has greatly improved because of this ritual as well. It empties my head and provides some sort of 'closure' to the day. Before this, I would simply stay up until I would be physically *very* tired before getting in bed. Now we go outside to talk for maybe 20-25 minutes or so. We get back inside, my SO will take 20 minutes to read a book in bed and I'll take that time to listen to some music or write the last emails of today in the living room, both just having a moment to ourselves before bed. Then I also get in the bed and we cuddle for another 10-15 minutes or so, totally stress and worry free cause we just talked through everything from that day, and then we go sleep. Sleeping is so nice now. I sleep a lot more since we started doing this and my sleep quality is amazing.|||Extensive orientation during high school. Career tests etc etc. Also: if you don't like your major, you can still switch to another one, although you most likely need to start over. But then again, when tuition fees is anywhere between 0 and a few grand per year, it's not that big of a hit, especially when most western countries have systems in place where the government gives you cheap student loans. In my country I for example can loan my tuition and living expenses at an interest of 0.4 percent, payback period of 35 years at a maximum of 4% of your income ABOVE minimum income.|||We actually do have a 'penalties method' in place, but it's really attached to our Dutch culture in which it is ok if you make mistakes, as long as you own up to them, learn about your mistakes and do better next time and not take mistakes too seriously, because 'hey, shit happens'. The system is that with very mistake you make (safety mistake, or you break glassware, do something stupid in general) you get counter on your fumehood glass, and if that counter hits 3 mistakes, you need to get cake for the whole group the next day and your counter is reset to zero. Essentially, we 'celebrate'  making mistakes because that's how you learn to be better but also make it a competition in which you can quantify the stupid things you did. (You had to buy 3 cakes last lab course?! Haha, you idiot, what did you do?)I guess having to bring cake if they make mistakes does not help in making them take it seriously though.. especially what you say about shaming the student in front of peers is something that is so unlike our culture.|||She's a small sized girl and a vegetarian. Don't underestimate the cost of meat. 250 grams of minced meat at Jumbo is like 2 euros and that's the cheapest proper meat available. If you eat meat every single day, that's already 60 euros a month in meat alone! If you have a balanced diet (which I try) you van get rid of the meat without nutrient deficiencies in your diet. Combine that with buying staples of rice and couscous etc in bulk (5 kg of couscous of 8 euros at my local Arabic food store) and groceries become super cheap.So yes, if you are single and not too big of an eater an VEGETARIAN.  You can save A LOT on groceries and 100 euros is totally doable. That being said, both I and this friend of mine don't spend money and chips, snacks, soda and all that stuff. That also saves a shit tonne in grocery costs as well.|||I'm your age and one of the biggest 'problems' I'm facing now (with both parents, one of which I bond way better to than the other) is the fact that I am realizing they also are.. well.. *people*. They are not just *mum* and *dad* and whatever that should entail, but they are individuals with dreams and hopes and fears. Sometimes they hate their children, sometimes they hate themselves, but they are a lot more than just the image we all have from what a mother or father should or should not be. It's so much more complicated now that maybe 5 years ago when I was a teenager if I compare my relationship with my parents.I think maybe that's what you are experiencing now as well. Your father is has been a great father, but maybe you did not get the chance to bond with him as a person. Imagine meeting a stranger on the street, could you suddenly feel the amount of love for that person you expect yourself to feel for a father or mother? I doubt it. Same with your dad. As you start to get to know him as a person, who may still be a stranger to you, you can't expect to feel love for him as for the love you felt for a father. If I were you, I'd simply give your dad a call and say: 'Hey dad, I miss you. Would you maybe like to go camping some time, just the two of us' (or whatever is popular in your family).  Get to know the man you call father, not just the function that man has fulfilled in the last 20 years.|||I agree with this, not my passion either but the perfect stepping stone for the kind of management positions I ambition later on in life.

The Duolingo French course *maybe* gets to you to a lower A2 level, not even close to the kind of proficiency you need.I think many people without a language learning background underestimate what actually fluency means, and how long it takes to achieve it. For example, I'm European from a country that's very strong in teaching children additional languages from an early age. I had some basic French at school, but if I would to start now and want to become fluent, I would need about 2 years with weekly professional classes (and of course self study and homework) to get to B2+ level. Maybe 2.5 to 3 to get to a very solid C1/C2- that you would actually need to be able to work exclusively in French. And I already now 5 other European languages (close to) fluently. If this is your first foreign language of are learning to actual fluency, it might take you more effort.|||Do you have the funds to be able to study here?

If a movie is rated 16+ in my country BY LAW the cinama can't sell any tickets to minors and need to check ID if they suspect a minor is sneaking in. Cinamas get fined if they fail to do so. Movies are rated for a reason.Editing for extra info: a 16+ rated movie in my country means that no tickets will be sold to people below 16 years Ã¡nd no one below 16 years will be allowed entry. They check ID both at the ticket booth and at the entrance to the cinema. Even if legal guardian buy tickets for their sub 16 year old kids, they won't be allowed in. If cinemas do, they will be fined and the policy actually enforces this by doing frequent checks in which minors will try to be allowed in. I just checked and Deadpool for example was rated 16+. Source: I used to work in a large national cinema chain.|||It sounds you are focusing on the maths and the exact way to work through a solution, instead of focusing on why each step in that solution is relevant to the question. If you are having trouble making that distinction, you might benefit from working out solution strategies. Take a set of tutorial questions and see if you can find a trend of what type of problem you are trying to solve, based on what type of answers the problems require.For example: you notice that in 3 different questions, the solution requires a Rayleigh's dimensional analysis and further manipulation of your analysis. By know, you know how to do those calculations, so don't focus on that. Look at the questions.. what type of problem are we talking about? What kind of follow up questions are there that use your Rayleigh's dimensional analysis. Formulate a strategy in words like: in the case of X a Rayleigh's dimensional analysis can be used to come to the conclusion that Y. These conclusions can be used deduct A, B and C. This makes sure you focus your learning on WHY you are doing something, not only HOW to do something.|||My SO and I take a moment every evening to sit outside on the balcony with a cup of tea, no distractions, and talk about whatever we feel like. Usually our relationship, or worries and things that made us happy that day. We have amazing communication going on in our relationship (4 years in and counting) with no jealousy, resentment or fights whatsoever, and I believe it's all due to this little evening ritual.I think this might help you guys a lot as well. You already push your bedtime an hour later to accommodate your SO. Take that hour to sit somewhere quiet without TV, without your phones etc and just talk. Not only will it make your SO probably not wake you anymore in the middle of the night, because there is a daily moment to talk about what everyone feels so your SO doesn't feel like her feelings need to be cropped up inside, your reduced sleep will also improve from this kind of 'sleep ritual'.|||I'd like to comment further on the west-european school systems that are being discussed here. In general terms what I am going to say holds true for most west-european countries (UK, Netherlands, France, Germany, Belgium, etc) although exact details may vary. European school students are very quick to separate students based on learning capabilities. For example, the Netherlands (i'm Dutch) and Germany have tiered secondary (high school) education, of which only the highest level will give you a diploma that allows entry to college/university. Other levels will lead to 'Applied Sciences' degrees or vocational school diplomas. Do you want to become a dentist? You need to go to university. Do you want to become a dentist assistant. Go to a university of applied sciences. Do you want to become a receptionist at a dentistry. Go to vocational school. In general the population will be split somewhere along the lines of 25% university educated/30% applied sciences educated/45% vocationally educated. Note however that due to the Bologna Process both university education Ã¡nd applied sciences are considered higher education, so I'm guessing that the OECD is referring to both categories in their statements. There is one big difference between the EU and US system. Having a tightly regulated tiered system allows for uniform education across the board. Meaning that a university degree of university x in dentistry is more or less similar in quality and difficulty as the degree of university y. This is absolutely not the case in the US. I know this because multiple family members of mine have done their tertiary education in the US. All of them did not have the Dutch entry requirements to allows them entry to Dutch universities, they did however got accepted to good colleges. Not the best of the countries, but best of the respective regions. Moreover, they were really high performing students at those colleges. It is simply not possible for a society to have everyone educated at a university level, simply because statistics in intelligence across a population. However, when it becomes the status quo to have a college education, the system itself will adjust and the level of college education will drop. We are starting to see the same thing slowly happening in the Netherlands as well and it's awful. I think this is what OP is talking about: the US system is fucked up and needs to be re-balanced.|||Really? Not even when you were a small child? Is there some other phrase you'd use in your language?|||No. Even at B2 (see the person I originally commented on) you wouldn't be able to keep up with technical or in-depth discussions within your field. BE includes being able to understand *main points* of technical texts and conversations on your area of expertise.Having in depth discussions within your field of expertise is actually a specific C1 requirement. Being able to have all-round complex or technical discussions outside of your direct area of expertise is a C2 criterion.|||In Europe, you can't switch topics for your graduate studies. If you want to do a graduate study in Law, you need an undergrad diploma in Law as an entry requirement. The education system in Europe is way different, where you already specialize yourself in a topic from day 1 at university, no general ed etc. The only exception are highly interdisciplinary graduate studies.. like.. environmental sciences for example. A graduate programme in Environmental Sciences will maybe allow a whole range of undergrad students from STEM/Law etc to enter, depending on the exact programme.|||My god, the memories. Glad I outgrew that behavior and am a bit more balanced now. But yeah, super type-A. Took on way too many AP classes to the point my school had to tell me: 'No. You can't choose even more, we simply can't schedule it for you anymore at this point.' Oops. Also, our school is rather old and it had a 100+ year old student organisation that would organize all kinds of activities. The organisation was failing so hard for quite some years, to the point the school threatened to shut down the organization. At about 15-16 years old I got together with a fellow class mate of mine and we put together a 7 page document on how to reform the organization and a multiyear plan  to revive it. The school made me the chair of the student organization soon after. I went back some time ago, the organization is still doing quite good, which made me proud.|||Sure, but taking out a CC lowers your score. Not paying off your CC also lowers your score, while paying it off raises your score. There is a reason why /personalfinance has daily topics on how to use CCs to most efficiently impact your score. The central registry does not give out scores. It's a governmental registry where banks and companies are required to report debts. Mortgages or private loans will be in there. As well as any debts resulting from unpaid phone bills and the like. Companies/banks cannot just make a hard pull from this registry. You'll have to give permission because essentially what they'll find once they pull your data is one big detailed list of every individual debt you have and what kind of debt it is. Not just a 'score'. The process on calculating mortgages is quite straightforward. First they calculate your maximum mortgage based on income and from the registry, they subtract a certain amount from that maximum based on how large each individual debt is and how high the interest is (and sometimes, what type of debts). You can do a very rough sketched calculation at home for the height of your mortgage because all parameters are more or less known. The actually offers might change a bit between banks, but not significantly.|||I'll have a look at BHA lotions. For what it's worth, I do have a skin care routine I'm very comfortable with and helps lower the redness considerably, which is mostly a combination of argan oil, castor oil and shea butter. I mostly use pure argan oil twice a day, which works wonders, and add some castor oil or shea butter at night if my skin is exceptionally dry.

If your mother is days away from dying and in an emotional delirium because of what is happening to her, I can understand simply saying whatever soothes her mind, simply to let her pass peacefully. However, although dying, she still has months to live, you are absolutely right to tell the truth. Simply because of one important reason: Your mother needs to know what kind of arrangements she needs to make for her young children.If you tell her you'll take them, she might take your word for it and write your name down as legal guardian in her will. If you say you won't, she knows where you stand and will maybe contact the fathers instead and involve them in helping the transition. The thing is: the people that will take care of those kids need to be involved way before your mother will pass. The kids are young, they might not understand properly that mum will be gone and not come back soon, also, considering both have different fathers, they will likely be split up after your mum passes. They need to be prepared for that too.|||That one tablespoon of oil is already 100+ calories.

Even if the person you're breaking up with is abusive towards you, it *will* hurt to go through these emotions and you *will* feel lonely. But remember: you will be mourning the loss of the relationship you wished you had, which is also a relationship this person could never provide to you. Going back to him will *not* be a solution to these feelings.|||You're on time with your planning, this will help you a lot. Ok, EU education 101. A bachelor degree will get you nowhere (although.. you are in CS and compared to all other degrees, there actually *is* a demand for bachelor CS students as the exception to this general rule). I think your best should would be to come here to do a masters degree, which in most cases will take 2 years. Most masters degrees are also taught in English by the way.I think this route is preferred, because you get to know the country first and have some time to orientate yourself to the markets really well and get the necessary contacts to get jobs. Also, you'll give yourself a year or two full immersion to learn the language to full working proficiency (B2+/C1 is *really* recommended if you want to work in France/Germany where general English proficiency is less in comparison to for example the Netherlands/Scandinavia). There are plenty of jobs by the way, especially if you are willing to relocate a bit and aren't stuck to a specific city in a specific country. However, we also have a strong labour force ourselves. This is another reason why I would suggest doing your masters degree over here, because it gives you a diploma which employees will recognize because native citizens will have the same qualifications.Another thing I always mention to US people thinking about coming to the EU: you need to realize how *different* day to day life is over here. Housing is small, very small. A 3 bedroom house with 1 bathroom of 120 square meter (1200 square feet?) for a family of 4 is considered either average or maybe even rather luxurious. Also, consider things like going out for dinner. A sit down dinner at a restaurant is really expensive, Europeans really only go out for dinner for special occasions or when on holidays. Also, take out, still expensive. A single McDonalds menu is 10 euros, while you can cook home made dinner for two for half that money, so get used to cooking for yourself every single day. These are just small examples about how different the mindset is between Europeans and Americans in day to day life. For many Americans this actually comes as quite a shock.|||My SO is TYPE_MENTION, together for almost 4 years already!I love my TYPE_MENTION, in daily life, I live a high stress, pressure cooker life with a lot of responsibilities and political games to play.The moment I get home to my SO, its like I enter my ultimate safe space. M6 TYPE_MENTION has a 'fuck it, that's bullshit' attitude to poltical games and all that shit so I simply can't take my work home so to say, which forces me to relax and let go for the evening.

I can simply tell my TYPE_MENTION 'I do not appreciate how you handled that situation' and we will talk about it like the rationals we are, without drama.My TYPE_MENTION tells me he likes being with me because of my ambition, that although he himself doesn't have large ambitions and is much more content having more free time to read and to work on hobbies, he enjoys experiencing ambition through me. He also likes how I pull him out of his comfort zone and get him to try the most amazing and crazy things together.

I'm doing 3 BA's as well (EU based), all at the same time, which I would have finished in 4 years, if it weren't for some health issues, now it will take 5 years.Same with planning for my masters degree, which I also plan to do 3 of (2x 2 year and 1x 1 year programmes), which will take a total of 3 years. This gives you 6 degrees in about 7 to 8 years, that makes me 25-26 years as I started out at 18 as most others. This guy is 29, so yeah, the time line checks out.The thing is, you'll have some overlap and can fill in courses from one programme into the minor of the other and vice versa. You don't do the full 180 ECTS credits for each bachelors. I also simply take more credits a year (90 vs the regular 60 ECTS) which adds up really quick.|||Those super low tuition countries provide government funding even for internationals. Each diploma a university delivers, will fetch them an additional check from the government to cover costs so the tuition can stay low. 10-15k tuition is more or less the price a 1 year degree costs, which is the norm form most other EU countries where only EU nationals are subsidized and non EU students pay the full price. The check the government gives out more or less compensates for the difference between the tuition price and the actual cost of providing education. In Europe, most countries are socialized systems, and universities are considered a public good, meaning a university isn't for profit and as such, will never ask more tuition other than to play even, simply because they could. It's not too good to be true, it's just a different philosophy.|||I don't mind them. I like seeing happy video's of people being happy.

My teenage years were rather tough, as my parents went through a very messy and nasty divorce. My dad and I liked the same heavy metal / rock music, and at that time I slipped into the goth subscene due to the emotional strain caused by the divorce. This was also the first time in my life when I showed interest in fashion and appearance in general. I never cared about it before, I hated shopping, and definitely wasn't a girly girl. Anyway, my mum is a *very* fashionable and a bit preppy woman, she did not like my move towards the goth aesthetic as all. My dad however, was in full support. We went shopping together so many times, and he really encouraged me to find my own style when I went tried out different goth styles. He taught me that only my opinion mattered when it came to how I look, and that confidence first and foremost comes from within, and not from acceptance of society by adhering to what society tells you what is pretty and beautiful. I have since grown out of my goth style, but still dress rather uniquely, simply because my style evolved to represent me as a person, instead of following trends. If anything, I consider this my father's greatest achievement in my upbringing. As in the end, this confidence extends far beyond simply fashion. It impacted my character and personality in many, many ways.|||If TYPE_MENTION are the stereotypical CEOs, TYPE_MENTION are the stereotypical directors.|||Hmm.. It's difficult for me to put into words. I'll give some examples: I have quite a clear long term imagine in my mind of how I want my *and our* life to be like. There are only limited types of people who can look at such long term visions, let alone enjoy looking at long term visions. My SO (who is either TYPE_MENTION or TYPE_MENTION, not sure yet), is not one of those people. I find it difficult to manage my urge and need to 'live in the future' and continuously shaping that future, while still including my SO in shaping that future as he is much more in the here and now. I find myself to be a bit overbearing (and dominant, and aggressive) in our relationship in this regard. This combines with a very strong personality trait: I operate under the believe that having considered all possible arguments I heard and could think of, my current opinion or train of thought is correct. If I get new info, new arguments, I will first play the ultimate devils advocate both out loud and internally, before settling on the conclusion that either I'm still right, or my opinion needs adjusting. This is *damn* annoying for a partner who not only needs to have rational discussion with me (are we going to buy a house?) but also the more emotional ones (do we value marriage and do want to get married?) which don't come easy to me to begin with and for which - as I found out because of my SO - I got pretty fucked up opinions and ideas. And those are only the discussion actually related to our relationship, let alone all the discussion we have over the course of maintaining our friendship. I asked my SO about this, he simply shrugged and said: 'I know you're hard headed, so I say what I have to say to you, then leave the conversation and I trust you value my input enough to carefully consider it. That's just you and how you function, and I love you.' Really.. damn.. I love him for it, but could you really expect someone to *actually* be able and willing to communicate in such a way? Also, this one is hard to admit: I am selfish. I too often catch myself thinking about what *I* want (see my first point about being future minded), and less about what *our* relationship *needs* in the right here right now. I strongly believe in the saying that in a relationship both people need to give 60% and take 40% so there is always more than enough to go around if someone actually needs it. But I must say, it's a conscious effort. I need to purposely ask how my SO's day was, if he's feeling OK, if I can do something for him, etc etc, because I don't simply register his needs like more feeling types would. Luckily, - again, my SO is amazing - he gets me and he has learned to be very upfront with me in communicating his needs. In the end, my main issue of why I think I'm difficult to be with, is that I notice how much my SO has learned about me, my personality and how much he 'gets' me, and somehow, I feel that I have not done so with him to the same extent. I somehow feel I need to push myself much, much harder to be a good partner, while it comes more naturally for him. My god, writing this all out makes me remember how I truly love this man. &lt;3|||My parents did this. The reason is quite simple in their case.. for me and my parents traveling is not just something we enjoy, it's a necessity. We get anxious and nervous if we stay in one place for too long and would rather eat sandwich dinners if money was tight so we could save for travel instead of not being able to travel. For them (and me as wel) traveling was a life priority that doesn't change when you have a kid. They traveled because they wanted to experience traveling  and took me along because a baby simply doesn't live very long when left to fend for itself.|||Ha. This happened just a few hours ago:I needed multiple major surgeries a few months ago (and a couple more a year before that), because of which I couldn't do my exam for a course that is a prerequisite to start my thesis. I NEED to pass this course, because the alternative is having a full year of delay, on top of the delays already caused by all my surgeries and medical issues.The resit was today. I've been intensively preparing for the resit the last couple of weeks and life kept throwing shitty curve balls at me. I hit all of them straight back in my shitty life's face, at which point point life decided 'fuck you'. I got a massive acute infection on wednesday and was admitted into the hospital yesterday. Full force medication and I wasn't allowed to eat or drink today in case I needed emergancy surgery.Well, this morning I decided to tell life 'fuck you too'.My illnesses have already taken 1.5 years from me, and will atleast take 1 more before I'm recovered. So I talked to my doctors about my exam, who discussed it among themselves about it as well. My exam was planned from 9 till 12 AM, and at 9:15 my doctor came back and just said 'go.' So I got my stuff, dragged my stupid body along on my crutches, got a bus and was at my exam at 10 AM. My prof, being the good man that he his (as he knew about my situation), gave me an extra 15 minutes at the end.So there I was, in pain, hungry, dehydrated and having a kind of emotional, mental and physical stress which I can't begin to explain, but fuck you life, I did it. I am so angry that I couldn't do my exam the way I wanted, as I would easily get an 8 or 9 out of 10 if I could have done it on my terms, but I do think I might actually passed the exam despite all this shit.After the exam I dragged myself back to the hospital and all the staff was waiting to ask me how it went. All were so happy for me. I laid down in my bed, got my extra paid medication and slept untill 6-7 PM. It's now 9 PM and I have a massive headache and my body hates me, but fuck it. I did it and I will not let my illness beat me.|||Seriously though, if numbers get this high, OP could most likely even pull of a medical holiday to any western European country and get it all done for cheaper.

Congrats on finding a good guy. :)|||It's not only appreciated, frankly, it's a necessity if you are planning on actually getting a career going in the Netherlands. There are a lot of options for education internationals to *get* a job in the Netherlands, but you'll notice your growth potential is very, *very* limited if you don't know the language. It's not something that many people will admit, as we like to come across as super tolerant and international minded, but behind close doors, being fluent in Dutch is an important factor in determining who gets a promotion and who doesn't.|||I'm Dutch, my uni has a bunch of English bachelors. I'm doing STEM and there are a bunch of different nationalities. Nobody cares about muslims or darker skinned people, as long as you respect the local culture they will respect yours. Especially with STEM most people just love their subject and care less about the people also in the programme in terms of personalities, disabilities or just general weirdness. Problems mostly occur when international students start complaining about things like alcohol use and for example (one I experienced), when they start calling Dutch women whores because of how they behave and dress.|||Something, something about how childbirth and a woman's education level are very closely correlated, most likely due to financial independence through education, giving freedom to women *not* to have children as they don't need to social standing of motherhood for their own personal security in life. In cultures and countries where it is absolutely not the norm for women to get an education (clearly, as is the case in this pic), this is absolutely the most amazing thing that professor can do to support women's rights and making women independent. This men helps one woman get an education, who will make sure her daughter (?) gets an education as well, and her daughter will as she'll grow up actually be given the choice to be childfree or not.|||TYPE_MENTION should be: Here's some chocolate, now shut the fuck up and stop crying and tell me how the fuck you plan to deal with this shit.|||Listen, I got an accident, broke my leg, needed 7 surgeries over the course of two years, was in a wheelchair because of it half the time and only just now do I start to be able to walk without pain. I know how crap you're feeling.Accidents happen. Shit happens. You need to get back in touch with your core goals. Your goal was never to do that race, the race was a signifier for achieving an underlying goal, be it improving your health, or fitness or whatever drove you to start working out.That underlying goal is still there and can still be fulfilled, you just need to adjust the signifier that shows you that you're actually succeeding in achieving the goal you set. Figure out why you wanted to do that race, why the workout was so important to you and find new ways to work on the core goals that accommodate the position you are currently in.|||Yes it will.

You are right when MRA/Feminists do very little about racial inequality, because simply, it's not part of their spectrum, while it is part of the egalitarian movement because the egalitarian movement (equality for all people) also embeds the racial equality movements, just like it embeds the gender equality movements.|||Ok, first things first. How many AP classes did you do in high school? The high school systems between the US and NL are so different, as the Dutch high school system is tiered with only the highest level diploma allowing entry to universities, unlike in the US, where a regular high school diploma allows you into college. Most NL universities therefor require a minimum number of AP classes or several years college education. |||Just wondering: what will you do when this kid grows up and will try to contact you him/herself once he/she's an adult? Just curious, because I can  understand both ways really.. once the kid grows up you won't have to parent him/her anymore and will be able to build an adult relationship + you won't need to bother with the mum. In the same way I can also understand not wanting a relationship with the adult kid, in the way many people who gave their kid up for closed adoptions don't want to.You might want to consider though, even if you don't want any relationship with the adult kid, to prepare a letter or whatever on your medical history, especially with regard to issues that might run in the family (early heart diseases, lot's of other issues). This is valuable information to have for the kid and I'm guessing the mum doesn't know you well enough to know these things herself.|||I dislike the general idea on this sub that every woman who once had the idea that she might want children one day are these crazy demon people who will do everything to fuck a man over and steal every damn penny those men will ever earn. *We* are just people, dependable, loyal, trustworthy people just like yourself and believe me, there are *far* more of us than this type of woman you're referring to.|||I love this, I could totally see this happen to me and my SO sometime in our life!Anyway, if this would happen to me, I'd would like to get a huuuuge bouquet of flowers, preferably roses.

You were just being silly, and I'm guessing a lot of silliness goes on in your relationship, so bring some of that silliness back. Maybe also go out on a date, invite her to go out for dinner and maybe watch deadpool at the movies or something. Get the fun back in your relationship asap I guess!|||I think that ship has sailed. From my perspective, I give my all in a relationship, but once it's done, it's done and I move on. I would feel very hesitant being friends with an ex if I would find out that ex still had feelings for me. It would create unneeded drama in my life and I would never be able to truly trust that persons intentions, my reasoning would be that it's not worth it and better to just cut all ties and let it go.|||A thing to seriously consider is whether the costs you're making for a car are worth it for your goals. I do a lot of weekend trips to European cities. For student standards, my trips are quite luxurious, as I'll sleep in hotels and eat out for all meals. A 4 day weekend trip, all includes (flight, public transport etc as well) will cost me about 400 euros. Depending on the travels you want to do with the car and frequency, you would be able to do many of those trips over the course of your studies for the costs of that car. Also, alternatively you could consider whether a train subscription isn't cheaper in your case. For example, a train subscription which will give you unlimited travel outside of rush hours is 100 euros a month. Even if you have to get single tickets to get to your foreign destination, it may still turn out to be cheaper. Especially if you are planning to take Dutch friends along on your trips who will most likely be able to travel for free as well.|||No, just some lower class university students with two jobless parents on welfare who is able to go to university through government funding and almost interest free loans because my country treats me like, you know, a human being.|||Because feminism at its core is a movement that tries to achieve equality by increasing women's rights. This made sense several decades ago, but now, I see there are more and more ways in which women hold privilege at the expense of men. For example, there are now more women earning university degrees then men and that trend is not going to slow down any time soon. Another example: men are treated like garbage when it comes to family law courts.Feminism simply refuses to address inequality that benefits women at the expense of men, which is fine, really, because of what feminism is (read my first line again). That's exactly the reason though why I do not call myself feminist, but egalitarian. This does not mean there is no need for feminism anymore per se and unlike many other egalitarians, I do still see the value of the feminist movement. There are still some issues in which women's rights need to be improved, both in the western world but especially in other regions (Middle East comes to mind).|||What will you be doing once you're married to him? I'm TYPE_MENTION with an TYPE_MENTION SO. We're young, though, in our 20s, but we already concluded I will be our high earning and we will have to relocate very often for my career. That will mean my SO will earn a lot less or very little. Once we are married I made a point of fully merging our incomes, because we are one team now, and what one of us earns, belongs to both of us. S9 we will add our incomes together, budget together and have a 'spending money budget' which will be equal for both of us and a shared 'date budget' for our dates. This makes us discuss whether we want to have onr fancy dinner on the Eiffel tower or weekly dinners at a local restaurant.I guess in the end this comes down to distributing costs among both of us on income ratio. Why do you want to pay 50% instead of 30% (he made double your income right?) which would be the fairly divided amount?I can also very much understand where your SO is coming for. Reminds me of my SO when he feels bad about me spending more on him/us and I tell him 'its just money, what does it matter?'.

Just to be sure. This differs between instition, so take your time to gather all relevant information for your specific situation.|||Because of societal demands made on men, the stereotypes men should adhere to. Men in western societies are socially forced to be 'masculine' just like women are forced to be 'feminine'. Sexism towards women is usually grounded in these believes, for example, girls being discouraged from doing STEM and pushed towards more 'feminine' fields such as health. The same goes towards men, one of the big issues when it comes to sexism against men to me is court bias in family law where men (even when arguably the better parent) will not be granted custody, because men are not supposed to be the people who care for children because that's not masculine. The patriarchy is setting the expectations of what constitutes masculinity and femininity, and even if it is men who are doing so, it doesn't mean it's not hurting men. Extremist feminist in my oppinion are moving to a matriarchy in which masculinity and femininity are redefined by women, but the same cycle continues.|||Dude, 4 months.. read that again, 4 months!

I also started out in chemistry and switched to chem eng after a few months. Yet I also don't ever in my life want to be a chemical engineer, hell no.But that's the point, I don't have to. A STEM degree is an entry point into an incredible range of careers. But if your uni is anything like mine, the chemistry department will give you the strong impression that the only reason to do chemistry is to get your PhD afterwards and slave away your years on the lab. But that's bullshit. If you want some alternative career paths directly related to chemistry, you can consider things like sales, patent law, food safety, becoming a teacher, working at a science museum, etc. If you want some ideas of careers totally unrelated which you can based on your STEM degree, think of consulting, management traineeships at various large companies also outside of the chemical industry, lots of IT related stuff.Many of these careers could very well lead to a role in which you would travel/work in Japan often, as Japan is quite a major player in the chemical sector. If you choose Japanese as your degree, you'll loose a lot of those options. One of my best friends studied Japanese actually, she recently graduated. She was one of the very few who got a job straight out of uni which closely related to her studies. The thing is, she planned for this meticulously from day one. She made sure to graduate top of her class, organized her studies in such a way she could do multiple semesters in Japan, choose an in demand and difficult minor, did many extracurricular activities including a board year relate to Japanese studies, and kept a part time job next to all of that to be able to pay for those semester in Japan at a tiny Japanese history museum. Sure, she can speak Japanese quite amazingly by now, and she loves Japanese language and culture, but so do all her class mates, and the only reason she got what she wanted and the others didn't was because she put in an unbelievable amount of work. If studying Japanese culture, history and linguistics on top of actually learning the language is your absolute passion, go for it, but realize what's waiting for you. If it isn't your absolute passion, realize 'liking and wanting to learn the language' is not enough to pull you through.|||I have a Midori with usually two inserts: one lined for misc notes just like you and a week+memo insert.

I avoid them where possible and simply don't engage. I simply don't want to deal with them because I don't have the energy.That being said, mature and stable SF's are really healthy for TYPE_MENTION to know and maybe even befriend. They aren't hysterical anymore and are able to provide a good learning opportunity. When communicating with them, I make sure to always use questions instead of opinions and statements, which still push a certain direction. So instead of 'You should tell John to back off' I'll say 'Considering you don't think John will pick up on subtle hints, how would you feel about simply telling him honestly that you don't appreciate his behaviour?'. But like I said, they need to be mature and stable.|||I'm not saying what I'm about to say applies to your wife, but I wanted to share your story about how my boyfriend handles a similar situation with me. I had an accident causing several surgeries and I gained 20 lbs during that time. When I got better I didn't like the fact that I gained weight of course, but I didn't hate my body either, it was just this down feeling of feeling shitty because of my injuries, the stress it caused because I fell behind on my studies and simply feeling just not right in my own body because of the weight gain. One of the other people said something about 'compliment addiction'. It rang true to me... Just pushing my boyfriend to get some additional compliments out, just to get a reaction. Anyways, my boyfriend at one point told me outright I needed to quit complaining. That he thinks I'm just as beautiful now as I was before and if I'd lost 20 lbs instead of gained it, his feelings would still be the same. That complaining wasn't getting me anywhere and wouldn't make me feel better. That I should either truly accept the weight gain and be happy with myself or get up from my ass and work out and eat less. That he'd accept and support  and help me with any choice I'd make, but that that choice must be made to begin with. After taking a long, hard look at myself I realized he was right and started to get out of that downwards spiral of feeling crap. Not recommended for all women, but it really worked for me... maybe you or someone else who stops by this post is helped by it.|||I don't get why this is an issue.

I am actually *very* smart when it comes to knowing how to work the system and learn for tests. The thing is, although I'm still getting by, I'm starting to notice my 'less intelligent' peers are starting to surpass me in terms of *actually* understanding what the fuck it is we're doing. In the end, being born with intelligence really is a curse, because we're lazy and never learned how to learn, be *really* dedicated and how to struggle and overcome intellectual obstacles. Because even when the conceptually hard topics now come easy to you, there will be a point where intuition isn't enough. You need a good brain combined with a very good work ethic. I will never be an engineer, because I'm simply not good enough anymore compared to my peers, and frankly, they have such a head start I will never be good enough anymore. I'm finding my own way when it comes to career orientation and I'll find a position in which I'll be really happy and content, somewhere on the intersection between strategic management and engineering, a perfect niche for me, but these issues will always be something I'll struggle with.

We both have been gaming since early childhood. We like different genres but we spend sooo much time gaming together. Me on my consoles and he on his PC that's right next to my TV. We tell eachother about our games and we learn eachothers game mechanics. Often when something cool is happening one of us pauses their game to have a look at what's happening in the others game. I love this so much about us.I hope we stay like this forever. My dad is in his 50s and he's the one who taught me how to game as a child. The man still plays a lot of console games. I often bring him games I've finished so he can play them, not just cheesy stuff, but also games like Deus Ex and Skyrim. Can't wait to be close to retirement age and just look at my SO and tell him: 'lets kill some monsters together'. That would be awesome.|||You might not know that US grad schools are *totally* different systems than European grad schools. Some EU student would fit better in the US system and vice versa.|||I'm Dutch, not German, so I'll speak from my Dutch perspective but I reckon our systems are quite similar. Others will likely correct me on this I might got wrong.Doing a medical degree as an international is *really, really* difficult. The requirements for German students are incredibly high already. Read top 5%-ish of students who did their Abitur, so they were even already pre selected for their academic abilities in high school. This makes this percentage compared to the general population (and for example a random US public high school without differentiation) even smaller.You'll need a very strong B2 level in German language probably to be even admitted, and in my experience with learning languages (7 EU languages, several fluent) B2 will make your life difficult still, a solid C1 would be a lot better. But to be come fluent in another language takes *a lot* of time and energy, which you'll need to be up for.Another thing: the EU is not like the US. Each country is their own with their own rules and regulations. This means switching between countries for undergrad/grad is very difficult. It also means once you got your German medical credentials, you aren't automatically allowed to work in other EU countries either. I would very much advise against switching schools and consider your full medical degree as one continuous educational path. And note, depending on your specialisation, getting your medical degree takes something like 8 to 12 years.Tuition in Germany is free, but to get your visa, you need to proof you have enough funds. That's about 10k you need to be able to show on a bank statement, *each* year. Usually you are allowed to work a couple of hours on your student visa, but from my experience with med students: good luck. Med is super intensive, most students simply don't have the time to work next to their studies. And even if you do during undergrad while you only have courses, when you hit grad you'll be working in the hospital for 50 hours a week for little to no reimbursement for several years and you'll certainly have no time or energy to work at another job. Still you'll need to show proof of sufficient funding. Something to think about beforehand: how will you pay for your living expenses if you're not able to work.About getting Spanish citizenship: it will help you in opening up the higher educational market, as you'll be allowed to study in all mainland (!) uni's at reduced EU tarrifs. In that case you could for example consider my university (University of Groningen, the Netherlands) who has an international medical school and teaches undergrad in English at 2k tuition a year instead of 20k+. But even still, all the above still holds true, wherever you might end up studying.|||Copy from my comment on another MBTI related post which dealt with the negative stereotype of TYPE_MENTION. I guess it fits here as well:As an TYPE_MENTION, let me tell you, TYPE_MENTION are amazing people. I wish every TYPE_MENTION a mature TYPE_MENTION with a good developed sensing function as their ultimate sidekick. One of my besties is an TYPE_MENTION and I seriously wouldn't have been as successful as I have in my life without her, and frankly, also vice versa.'My' TYPE_MENTION keeps me grounded in reality when my mind is flying off when building this big mental network of 'this is how the world is supposed to be run and I will recreate and rebuild it in this image I created in my head'. Whenever I put my thoughts into action, I will always make sure to run it either past my TYPE_MENTION or similar for advice whether my approach is indeed as efficient and correct as I think it is. Usually they convince me of other ways of doing it or to adjust course, and the execution improves because of it. The TYPE_MENTION ability to simple get what's behind an idea, a vision and to be able to take those ideas and visions and analyse how they can be brought to real life, which actions would work, which not.. it always impresses me so muh. My TYPE_MENTION on the other hand can sometimes - as I call it - get stuck in the status quo, especially when it comes to personal / career development. My TYPE_MENTION run their ideas and plans cross me, because of so many years knowing each other, I've been building long term possibility outcomes for them as well, which they like to use and rely on to make decisions when they feel stuck.TYPE_MENTION are beyond amazing.

At my Dutch uni (STEM degree) I doubt work experience would be recognized, as the degrees are very academically/scienfitically focussed. Then again, OP is talking about a design degree, which may not be university education in the Netherlands, probably applied university education.|||Guess I'm the stereotype? I'm an TYPE_MENTION female.. but for me, it's not what high heels represent though, especially not according to your definition. Especially as a female, it's really though at times to be a stereotypical male leader type. I am very conscious of my appearance and what appearance can do to people and how it influences them. Especially men. I dress hyper feminine (only skirts and dresses in traditional styles, feminine A-line or pencil) and practically always wear heels. For me, it's a power play on men who are (subconsciously) sexist, and to an extent also a power play on women who suffer from queen of the bee hive syndrome. Those men can't deal with strong women, because they see women in supporting roles only. So when I show up all feminine, it fucks with their heads and they shut up, because their brain simple can't compute how someone who *looks* so much like the feminine stereotype, can be such a strong independent alpha type.|||Not that I know of.|||I downloaden Win10 as an early adopter.

I worked out every single detail and that means I can retrace my students thinking steps back to the very beginning to see where things go wrong in their heads.When I apply for TA jobs I simply bring my hardcover notes with me and hand them over during the interview and tell the professor he can keep them with them for a few days to review as long as I can pick them up afterwards. Haven't been turned down even a single time for a TA position, even though there are still students with (far) better grades than me. Also, when I have to teach I bring my notes with me. Because I have all the bits of relevant mathemathical backgrounds tossed in at the relevant sections students rarely get to question me off guard.|||I had my own high school mathematics teacher tell me I would outright fail at engineering, while my GPA was higher than that of many boys who also wanted to get into engineering. I had one specific aunt tell me I shouldn't do engineering, because I'd fail and should choose maybe a language or psychology instead. My mother wasn't openly opposed, but made it clear she'd rather see me in a creative field. I had to cut several friends from my life who made sexist remarks about women in STEM.  Jokes on all of them though, I'm graduating this year with a double engineering degree.|||And this is were you are wrong, because TYPE_MENTION (together with TYPE_MENTION, our partners is crime) are actually quite consistently measured to have the **highest** EQ of *all* types, even when using different methods and constructs. Here's one [pdf](https://www.hpsys.com/PDFs/Type_%20and_EI_Landscapes2.pdf) that discusses this.So no, when I say that in general TYPE_MENTION are actually very strong at reading the room and picking up on social ques, that's not giving myself too much credit.

I misread your comment.|||A mix between Joan Holloway (Mad Men) in terms of fit and overall feeling and Claire Underwood (House of Cards) in terms of her beautiful classic style that fits every occasion.|||So, like the other person who commented, I as well have experience with a similar situation. I am currently in a long term relationship with my SO who also has a background with depression and anxiety. A lot of what you are saying hits very close to home. I am currently early 20s (also got together when I was in my teens), and my SO is in his late 20s. When he was our age, my SO went through a full on depressive episode, for which he had to be hospitalized and needed long term daily treatment at the hospitals psychiatric unit. I didn't know him back then. I got together with him once he was deemed 'healthy' again and after he picked up his studies etc. So, unlike the other person, I am going to tell you about my relationship, and tell you you can have a very satisfying and happy relationship, despite your SO's issues. 1-2 years into our relationship, my SO started to slip again and went into a relapse after a traumatic experience. I so, *so* get the 'why can't I just be dead, just fade away right now and not exist anymore' conversations. I know how much it hurts to hear, like a sharp, long knife cutting straight through your heart, while feeling totally helpless yourself. I get having to calm down your SO when he/she is in a full blown panic attack and not one rational argument can get through, because everything is black and white and they truly believe whatever is happening will undoubtably end in catastrophe.When it got bad, my SO told me: \\\"I need to go back to the psychiatry unit and get treatment, please go with me to our GP to ask whether he can send a letter to the hospital for emergency treatment.\\\" I did, and went with him to all the long intake meetings with the psychiatrists, and after that was all settled, to his first meeting with his psychologist who would treat him. At this point, I was exhausted. I felt like I was giving up everything I was to take care of him. I truly felt that the only reason he was still somewhat functioning, was because I supported him and took most of his work out of his hands.The treatment he would get was similar to the treatment he received before, so he knew the drill of one particular key exercise. I didn't know jack shit about mental illnesses. So, at one point, I asked the psychologist if she could give me some reading material on that exercise, so *I* could learn more about it and help him with his exercises. What happened next was a key turning point which saved my relationship.. His psychologist looked at me and said: \\\"No. I am not going to do that. You cannot help him, you *may not* help him. He has to do this all on his own, and as long as you are there to act as his crutch, he will never get over his illness. Moreover, I don't think you should visit these meetings anymore, he is more than capable to get on his bike and come see me on his own.\\\"It was hard for me, but I took it to heart, and I indeed stopped being his crutch and he, on his end, stopped depending on me and started to take control of his life again, discussing his issue with his psychologist, instead of me. Of course, we would still discuss how we felt, what our issues were, but he didn't *burden* me with his issues anymore and I started to take care of me *first* again. Anyway, it's been a long tough road. It still is. But he's slowly recovering and we share way more happy moments than sad ones, and those angry/sad/panicked outburst have become less frequent and less intense, so the happy moments more than make up for it. It's not an easy relationship, I know that, but it's a very good, strong, and in my opinion healthy one. I think you can have the same.. but really, the key I'm trying to convey is that your SO **NEEDS** professional treatment and you need to step away from a mental health support role. She needs to deal with her problems *alone*, you can't be the one to solve them for her. You being happy in this relationship will be totally dependent on her being willing to look for professional help. If she doesn't, you can't be with her, if she does, like me, I think you can still be very happy in your relationship with her.Good luck. &lt;3|||You make great points about how jewelry draws attention to parts of your body. Considering my clothes are highly fitted, I don't think I should emphasize my 'sexiness' any more with jewelry. More attention to my face (or hands) would be more appropriate. Your comment also made me realize that's probably what I was looking for to begin with when I wrote this post, as my clothes need some balancing out. Thanks for you comment!|||I'm also an engineering who's making a strategic choice to study Chinese. I've been at it for about a year now, just finished my HSK2 course. I started from absolutely zero. I found that Chinese isn't an easy language to learn, but definitely not as hard as I thought it would be. However, I'm European so I already know 5 other languages and have been getting formal language education continuously since age 10. If you start from zero, I think it's important to realize how long it takes to achieve true fluency in a language to be able to actually work in that language. I noticed many people would call themselves fluent once they are able to keep some generic conversation going without too much trouble, but for work purposes you need to get way past that point. Anyway, I'm taking one class a week, so I'm not doing some intensive course. At this rate, I expect to get to HSK6 in about another 3 to 4 years.. however, HSK6 (even if it's the highest level of HSK) is not a fluent level. To get to that point I'll probably need some heavy immersion for at least a year.|||I know, but I simply don't know the canadian systems well, I figured, with an US comparison OP will be able to extrapolate the info to his situation.

During this conversation you need to tell him he did a good thing to tell you about it and should continue telling you and you will be asking again next week when he gets back. Even tell him that you told his father and how he should act when his father confronts him with this information.If your son goes to his father without this conversation and his father will scold at him for telling you, your still will immediately shut down and not talk to you about it again.|||I think I can agree, I use patriarchy and matriarchy as words to adress concepts and ideas of society shaped primarily by one sex or the other. I could use other words, but that would not change the remainder of my argument.|||As always, STEM gives good job perspectives, as does healthcare (both on university - doctors - and applied level - nurses) but then again: I believe the most important thing is to know what you want to do with your degree, and put all your effort into that. So many students just start out doing something, party all the time, get minimal passing grades and after 4-5 years have nothing to show for their time at uni... those are the people who don't get jobs. People who know what they want, get good grades, do the relevant extra curriculars and *network* in the field they want to work in from the start do find work. If found this link for you: https://www.nuffic.nl/en/library/education-system-canada.pdfNuffic is the Dutch organization that does diploma appreciations. You can have a look at that document to see whether your high school diploma would be considered sufficient over here. Some tips: a 'VWO diploma' is what you need to get admitted to a university, a 'HAVO diploma' to get admitted to a university of applied science. A uni of applied science, although called a uni, is a higher education institution which teaches more practical and vocational degrees, such becoming a nurse, lab technician, physical therapist etc.|||Fellow female TYPE_MENTION who refuses to call herself feminist. Commenting just out of honest interest in your (TYPE_MENTION) opinion.I don't call myself feminist because I believe mainstream feminism today (not just the 'feminazi' type) does not fight for real gender equality, but only  to stenghten women's position in society. Although there are many societal issues in which this is necessary, I feel that without balancing gender equality towards creating a level playing field in terms of male gender injustice, feminism will be detrimental to society. Some example topics: education (in my country there are now significantly more female uni graduates then men) and family law (where men are not considered good caretakers).I call myself egalitarian instead for this reason.|||If you take a close look you'll see it's Brand beer crates the students are using.

I usually don't tell this to people because people interpret it as arrogance, but I'm on my way to get 3 degrees: ChemEng, Industrial Eng specializing in process technology and Business Aministration specializing in technology management. A super nice sandwich to get me ready for higher management at industrial multinationals.It's the best decision I made. It's incredibly fun to have synergy between degree programmes and degree specific courses and I actually found the workload doable, but don't underestimate it, it takes a lot of *time*. I'm in Europe so our credit system is different, but I take 90-100 European credits a year, while 60 is the normal workload. My saving grace was to actually plan *all* courses years ahead to make sure tough courses are balanced by easier courses. If you don't plan ahead, it's hopeless.|||You're together for 7 years, I don't know, at some point in your relationship I guess it's time to develop an 'us against the world' mentality in which you consider what is best for you as a *couple*, not you as an individual in your relationship. You say your boyfriend is getting burned out. That's serious. Can you really ask of your life partner to sacrifice his mental health just because you'll still be able to have simple luxury? To me, my partners well being would come way before daily starbucks, nice clothes and regular restaurant visits.Are you fearing him going part time will be a slippery slope to him quitting altogether and mooching off your income?I agree with others your SO needs to consider new career paths. But quite frankly.. as a full time burned out teacher there is no way in hell he'll have to peace of mind to think about such things. Maybe consider talking ro him about this and offer to take on more household expenses for one year while he can do part time and in that year he'll need to figure out what he wants and get a full time job?|||Again, the EU consists of a bunch of separate countries. It's not like the US and its states . If you are having trouble finding info on *European* universities, try googling for universities of a specific country. Most countries have overview websites on which you can compare the universities of that country. That also means 'I want to study in Europe' is a stupid statement. You should consider in which country you would like to study first, considering average tuition fees, how easy it is to get in etc etc, and then you can look for specific universities.And you know, I really think studying med over here for cheap is simply not in the realm of possibilities for you. If you are really dead set on being a doctor, maybe its better to stay in the US. You'd be better of considering other options: medical biology or biomedical engineering for example. But if you are at all open for other options, you should really re-evaluate your decision to go to med school to begin with, as you *really* need some deep dedication to get through med school.|||From an inclusiveness perspective, I'd much rather have all the internationals mingle with the native Dutch students and ask their questions to both groups. As much as how great ESN (for example is), it makes me sad to see internationals so separated at times from the Dutch students. And I get it, from both internationals and the Dutch, it takes more effort to get together and form a new, shared perspective. But I think it's worth it, to build a shared, inclusive community. So, in any case, I'm Dutch, if you have any questions I can help with, let me know! I'm happy to help where I can.|||Came here to say the same. Even though I'm overseas and the culture here may be a bit different, but extracurriculars over here are mostly meant as a proof of character for potential employers. I think putting in the effort to start a new career while keeping a full time job on the side is quite a proof of character already.|||I'll copy paste my comment from an earlier post of someone who was also confused about being TYPE_MENTION vs TYPE_MENTION especially because of the difference in COGFUNC_MENTION and COGFUNC_MENTION with regard to the function stack. I think it might apply to use as well. (This person thought he/she both had COGFUNC_MENTION and COGFUNC_MENTION, which doesnt fit any of the type stacks)--Are you sure you are not confusing COGFUNC_MENTION and COGFUNC_MENTION? I can see how the tertiary COGFUNC_MENTION function of an TYPE_MENTION can seem very similar to the secondary COGFUNC_MENTION function of an TYPE_MENTION, as they both deal with broad vision based idea synthesizing. For example, I am definitely an TYPE_MENTION and I really don't use any COGFUNC_MENTION to be honest, even though I do have a very strong COGFUNC_MENTION (which I depend on a lot more). I rarely think 'well, this is the way it worked for me in the past when I dealt with problem X, so I'll apply the same tactic to this new problem Y because both problems have similar characteristics A,B and C and maybe tweak my approach a bit considering they don't share characteristic D.' I like many other TYPE_MENTION don't work to solve specific problems anyway like TYPE_MENTION do. An TYPE_MENTION will solve a problem to reestablish the currently disturbed status quo to keep the organizational engine running in top efficiency with as little hurt and drama as possible (I respect TYPE_MENTION so much for this), while an TYPE_MENTION will use the problem at hand to force a new status quo that's more in line with their greater vision of what they want their organization to be.This is also exactly the difference between COGFUNC_MENTION and COGFUNC_MENTION. An TYPE_MENTION will use COGFUNC_MENTION to take into account all the different possibilities of how a problem can solved and what the consequences will be, and then concentrate those possibilities into a choice that benefits the TYPE_MENTION vision most. An TYPE_MENTION will use COGFUNC_MENTION to check their COGFUNC_MENTION reference model for maybe even bÃ©tter solutions to a problem, even if they have no experience using that approach yet. For an TYPE_MENTION the N-component is the actual decision making process, while for an TYPE_MENTION the N-component is more of a support to the COGFUNC_MENTION decision making process.|||A few weeks before your birthday, say 5-6 weeks ago, you'd say something like: You know, I'd really like to get x for my birthday or do y. In which you make x or y specific enough that there is room for your SO to pick something himself, but makes sure it's something you'd like.Examples:For my birthday I'd really like it if we could keep it simple, maybe you can get me some flowers and a really nice homemade meal? My notebooks are almost full, I'd really like some new quality notebooks for my birthday.My perfume bottle is almost empty, perfume would make a nice birthday gift.Etc etc. This still leaves a lot of options for your SO to pick something special for you on his own initiative and also doesn't set a budget which my causr issues, but helps him to actually know what you'd like to get.|||For Germany/the Netherlands: google 'technical universities'. Some examples: TU/Delft, TU/Berlin and many others. They are academic level universities which provide engineering education only. Most masters programmes will be given in English, so that's a plus. How are your funds? Tuition in the Netherlands for non-EU/EEA are very high, Germany is a lot cheaper.|||Quite simply, most of the examples I mentioned point directly to the difficulty women face when trying to combine a career and family. Quite frankly, women who wish to work full time are still expected to take up most of the childcare as well. I think it is important for fathers to be considered equal and just as capable as mothers, and get the same rights as mothers, so they can share the burden that raising a child puts on a career. I want it to be socially acceptable for fathers to be stay at home fathers. I want fathers to get paternity leave to help in the difficult early months, just like the mother. I want fathers (and men in general) who suffer from depression to be taken just as seriously as women when they show their pain and seek help, instead of 'being the strong guy' and committing suicide in the end, which leaves to woman alone to raise their children. I believe, when men are truly considered equal in terms of the more 'feminine' side of society that is raising children and being regarded as actual emotional beings, women in general will be able to more fairly and equally pursue their careers and as such get into positions of power. This directly relates to research regarding wage gaps, which shows that men in women in similar points of their career with similar background have *no* difference in wages, but that the wage gap is due to decisions like working part time because of children, because society still forces women to do so for men are not considered as much a caretaker of their own children compared to the women.|||As an TYPE_MENTION, let me tell you, TYPE_MENTION are amazing people. I wish every TYPE_MENTION a mature TYPE_MENTION with a good developed sensing function as their ultimate sidekick. One of my besties is an TYPE_MENTION and I seriously wouldn't have been as successful as I have in my life without her, and frankly, also vice versa.'My' TYPE_MENTION keeps me grounded in reality when my mind is flying off when building this big mental network of 'this is how the world is supposed to be run and I will recreate and rebuild it in this image I created in my head'. Whenever I put my thoughts into action, I will *always* make sure to run it either past my TYPE_MENTION or similar to for advice whether my approach is indeed as efficient and correct as I think it is. *Usually* they convince me of other ways of doing it or to adjust course, and the execution improves because of it. The TYPE_MENTION ability to simple *get* what's behind an idea, a vision and to be able to take those ideas and visions and analyse how they can be brought to real life, which actions would work, which not.. it always impresses me so muh. My TYPE_MENTION on the other hand can sometimes - as I call it - get stuck in the status quo, especially when it comes to personal / career development. My TYPE_MENTION run their ideas and plans cross me, because of so many years knowing each other, I've been building long term possibility outcomes for them as well, which they like to use and rely on to make decisions when they feel stuck.TYPE_MENTION are beyond amazing. Never let anyone tell you otherwise.|||But then again, US bachelors are 4 years and Bologna bachelors 3 years. Yes, US bachelors are more general, however, in my experience the number of 'relevant' courses are about the same between US and Bologna, especially considering almost all Bologna degrees have a 30 ECs minor which usually aren't used for specialization but for broadening courses.|||I get what you are saying, but for most TYPE_MENTION it wouldn't work. TYPE_MENTION are always very future focussed.. the moment you start to crawl close to the goal you set out to do, the goal is reconsidered and pushed forward.. it's about the process not the result. Most TYPE_MENTION never really celebrate achievements because by the time they achieve something, they are already busy trying to achieve the next thing on their mind.What you are describing requires a lot of thorough reflection of the past. Which TYPE_MENTION mostly simply aren't interested in.|||I (23F) do a master's in Business Administration next to an Engineering master. I am also extremely involved with student life in Groningen, both in the more 'fun and party' communities as well as the very serious side of student participation. Although I call the faculty of science and engineering my home, I know a fair bit about the faculty of economics and business as well. If your daughter wants to hang out with some 'regular' students outside of the officially organized student for a day thing, shoot me a PM. If I'm available I'd be more than happy to take her out for lunch or dinner or a coca cola in the evening at one of the student associations or whatever and introduce her to some of my friends if she wants to get to know the city and university a bit better. I had random people do this for me when I was 16-17 years old and it helped me *a lot* when deciding what and where to study. I'd be happy to do the same for her.|||Ok, example: You're a citizen of Canada and France, and you live in Canada and want to visit France. When you leave Canada, you cross Canadian border exit control. When you enter France, you cross France border entry control. When you go back home from France to Canada, you first cross French border exit control and then pass Canadian border entry control. In you A and B example, this means that when you travel from A to B, entering B, you cross border control TWICE and most countries require you to essentially 'switch' passports in that case while in between border controls. So yes, you enter A (France) on your French passport and exit France again on your French passport. In practice, this is border control when you get to the airport into the terminal halls. But you enter Canada on your Canadian passport and again, which is border control when you land in Canada before you get your bags and leave the airport. If you leave Canada for another trip, you use your Canadian passport.|||The fact that you are responding to him like you do makes you cool in my book.

Same story, freshmen lovers etc. My boyfriend got the chance to do a research internship at a world famous university, also three months long. He was hesitant to go, because we'd be apart for a few months. I kicked his butt and told him there is NO FUCKING WAY he could let this opportunity slip. And you know why? Because I'm planning to spend the next 50 years with this guy, and a few months is nothing on a lifetime.You need to have a good solid discussion with your guy on where you see yourselves in the future.

It's not just about the three months, it's about the bigger picture.|||Just to be sure: no college means no general ed either! If you'd enroll for a law bachelor degree, you really would only have law related courses from day 1. Most bachelor programmes have a small set of electives in the later years which can be used to expand a bit into different fields (usually called your minor, vs in this case law as your major).|||I'm also finishing up my ChemEng bachelor and went through a similar crisis myself. I realised I really liked ChemEng but simply didn't like the typical ChemEng career, or engineering careers in general. I found out I wanted to focus more on things like decision making on building factories for future needs, where to build these factories in the world etc and a lot less on how the plant itself works. For me, I decided to finish my engineering degree but switch over to a management master instead. I guess my advice is to think about what you want to do in the next 40 years as a career and see which diploma would help you the most in that regard.|||Yup, you'd pay Dutch tuition and you'd probably also be allowed to take out Dutch government student loans which are (close to) zero percent interest. You should check this! Google 'DUO' or 'Dienst Uitvoering Onderwijs' and give them a call or email them.For studies, you should consider the University of Groningen! Groningen is an awesome student city and the uni is going through some real internationalisation processes to make it a very open and inclusive place to internationals, unlike many other unis who don't emphasize inclusion as much and just focus on offering their programmes in English. If you look on the website, you'll notice a majority of all bachelor (!!) programmes are already in English, and *all* STEM degrees are offered in English.|||I would suggest starting to learn Dutch the moment you get here.

Both should have their own hobby's and friends, really not everything should have to be shared and done as a couple. I think you don't necessarily need to find *single* friends, because friends who are in a relationship/marriage like the one described above, will probably still give you the kind of friendship you are looking for. At your age, that might broaden the pool of potential friends quite a lot.And if you befriend guys who are in those kind of relationships to go out with, they'd truly be the perfect wing man, because they won't steal your potential date for themselves!|||How many high school AP courses did you take (and pass)?|||I'm actually doubting about the same boots!

I want to get a 'Women in Science' running in house, guided by our own staff, and once this works and has shown there is a good demand and interest for it, I want to expand with a sister programme called 'Women in Industry'. Same concept, but different career paths. The second is a bit more difficult to set up, because you can't run it fully in house so I don't have the appropriatr network yet.|||This is why so many people on here recommend doing a masters degree in your target country. Especially for the Netherlands and Germany, where frankly, a bachelors degree is worth shit and a masters degree is expected, especially in oversaturated fields like psychology. A masters give you an opportunity to get into the country for a longer period of time without much requirements and will simply buy you time to learn the language and network, network, network to get a job afterwards.The only issue is the rigid system. I know in the US is relatively easy to switch fields between undergrad and grad school. In Western Europe, not so much, you usually need a bachelors degree in a relevant field to be admitted into that masters degree programme.. You can switch over (at least in the Netherlands), but it will take another year or 1.5 of (expensive) and heavy studying to switch to another field for graduate studies, and these trajectories aren't even available for all degree programmes.|||Are you sure? Using vacuum pumps on wounds is actually a legit medical procedure. I had a vacuum pump installed on one of my pumps after the so manieth surgery on the same spot to the point that all the scar tissue didn't allow for proper healing. They put a vac on it to help it heal by artificially keeping a blood flow going and have the would slowing heal from inside out, instead of attaching the would walls with stitches and letting it heal the 'normal' way. I work with vacuum pumps in a chemical lab setting, so I know what these things can do, by I was serious surprised by how little additional blood loss there actually was when using this medical vacuum pump.|||Ah joh, 'waarom zou ik op groep 8 niveau moeten kunnen rekenen als ik alleen maar in de onderbouw les wil geven'?

Your bust and hip evened out very nicely with your current weight.I think I will start using my measurements as a stat, instead of weight. I actually measured myself again following your post, and I'm at 110-85-119 at my current weight of about 86 kg. I remember that a few years ago when I was about 75 kg, I measured at 102-78-114. Looking at myself critically, I've passed the point where my body has been storing fat in mainly on my hips and bust, and instead I got a bit of a tummy which I didn't have before. Also your backfat comment... Yup. I mean, yeah my boobs got bigger, as I don't fit into the cups of my old bra anymore, but they haven't grown that much compared to my underbust measurements, so clearly, that's something to work on as well. I think it should be doable for me to go down to a waist of maybe 74-75 cm without it affecting my shape too much. It also a measurement that takes time to go down and something I wouldn't be able to stress over from day to day, week to week, as my measurements naturally fluctuate during to my menstrual cycle and such.|||What do you mean with 'bordering TYPE_MENTION' by the way? The TYPE_MENTION and TYPE_MENTION function stacks are not thÃ¡t similar (like TYPE_MENTION vs TYPE_MENTION for example), except for a dominant COGFUNC_MENTION.|||I decided to put it in an easy Vanguard S&amp;P 500 fund for now. I will probably start diversifying at some point, but I figured I still have time to that (I'm only 22 right now), and I didn't feel like bothering managing multiple funds over such a small amount, especially if in a few years I might reconsider which funds to put money in.|||No, staying awake for surgery is amazing stuff, seriously! I broke my leg once, and had every complication in the book, needing 6 surgeries in total, of which 3 major hospitalizations. I got an epidural and got approved by my surgeon to go in awake. The anaesthesicians thought we were crazy, but the surgeon and I loved it. I could not see anything (sadly!), because of the sterilized curtain in front of you, but my surgeon would narrate the whole procedure step by step for me, and send over one of his assistants every once in a while when he took out another screw or plate to show me. He even showed me the infected fistulas he took from my leg before they send it to the lab for processing.The anaesthesician kept asking every 10 minutes if I was sure I didn't want to sleep. Apparently, it isn't often they have patient in the OR who enjoy stuff like this. One time, I had a local block anaesthesia instead of an epidural. They take this echo machine to visually find the nerves in your leg and put a needle straight to the nerve to block it. I got lucky cause the anaesthesician was teaching one of his new baby interns, so he let me watch the screen together with him and the intern and got to explain everything he did in detail to both of us. You could actually see the sedative fluid blow up part of the nerf like a little baloon. It was amazing. Loved it.|||You wouldn't know about it, even though it very likely does happen. Sexism in science and engineering is subtle and as a woman, you can't always battle it on your own. Especially if you are not super vocal and assertive, a female student would just shut up and put it to the back of her mind. Having a conversation in which a female adult role model would ask a group of female students: \\\"are you facing any of this, because if you do, you need to know it is very common and you should feel free and safe to talk about it\\\" can make all the difference. I'm a female engineering student and I faced to sexist comments that are supposed to be 'funny'. I have a friend who got raped by a fellow student and had to see the guy daily for another year because policy couldn't do anything. This shit does happen, and if women are a small minority, they need the support of one another to not outright quit engineering all together. The fact that you are not aware of it usually means two things:1. You mean to be a good, non-sexist guy who believes in equality.2. You are simply oblivious to this being the daily reality of your female classmates.And that's ok. Most men fall into this category.. I'd say try to be aware. Talk to and befriend your female classmates and critically  evaluate the behaviour of your male classmates to see if you can recognize sexist behaviour. Having men support equality is just as important as women supporting equality.|||When I started out some years ago with Dark Souls 1 I never even got to finish the game, even with all the wiki's and tutorials in the world. It was just so damn hard. But with each game I got better, to the point where I'm now blazing through Dark Souls 3 with very few issues. It's a fun journey, don't give up on it!|||Yes, European job markets vs. American jobs markets are like night and day. As I posted, median household income is about 32k pre tax and the normal distribution is really narrow and also kept narrow through progressive taxation. We would be getting about 60k euros annual as a household income, which is already on the very high end of the distribution. If we were to go to live in the US, our combined income would most likely be above 150k dollars at that stage. We don't have a 'millionaire culture' in the Netherlands, if you work for public institutions (schools, universities, hospitals, etc) for example no one is allowed by law to earn more than about 230k a year, while in the US these people would be paid millions. However, this does mean that although really no one is filthy rich in this country, also no one is dirt poor and we can have things like these kind of generous student loan systems and reduced tuition fees (2k paid by the students and an additional 10k paid directly to the university by the government).|||Damn that's tough. I must saw though it's an incredible show of character how you are able and willing to admit to yourself you are having issues and how you want to chance. That's a strength you should be proud of and hold on to tightly. Do you have access to mental health care services? That would be a place to start. Reading your post, I get the feeling you're taking these *actions* to satisfy a certain need, itch or feeling.Therapy could help uncover what those needs, itches and feelings are and help you deal with those underlying issues that are the cause of these actions. If you don't have access to mental healthcare services, this might also be a process of could start yourself by reading (credible) self help books on proven therapy methods, though obviously it will be likely more difficult to get through. That being said, it will be difficult either way. Any good therapist will tell you he/she isn't going to solve your problems for you, you are going to solve your problems for you. The therapist will only be there for guidance and accountability.|||Extraversion stands for the fact that TYPE_MENTION information processing is an externally driven proces, **not** that TYPE_MENTION are and should be social butterflies that like to endlessly party. You can be TYPE_MENTION and still be the most socially introverted person on earth. More likely answer: TYPE_MENTION have inferior COGFUNC_MENTION. Maybe OP gets called a robot because all action and reasoning is solely rational and rule based, without taking a moral consideration into account, like, you know, and actual robot.|||Winst uit DUO schulden hebben trouwens nog een extra component: studieschuld is box 3 aftrekbaar, waardoor je drempel voor vermogensbelasting een stuk hoger ligt terwijl rente op de DUO schuld minimaal is (dit jaar zelf 0%).|||Maybe you can contact Laura's family directly through the site?|||My SO gets me flowers about 5 or 6 times a year, either to celebrate something (once or twice a year) or just randomly 'because I love you and you are amazing'.I kind of expect the flowers when we celebrate something (graduating, finishing a thesis, or whatever) but those random flower moments are what makes it special.Right now I am actually thinking about how long it has been since he last got me flowers... And I realize I might get some flowers again in the coming weeks. Thinking about this makes me super excited and happy, even long before I actually get the flowers.|||Not Australian or American, but I wonder... Those senior lecturers, do they have their own research group or do they only teach?|||Great job, I also study Industrial Engineering. It's a great degree with a lot of engineering in it, but the people studying for their degree and the professors teaching it really do approach the engineering aspects from a more overarching business/societal view, instead of being really hard core engineers who's absolute love and passion is the typical mathematical grinding an engineer has to do. Feel free to PM me with whatever questions you might have! Edit: I should add I've also been an international student buddy for incoming students and appointed mentor to first years. So if you have any questions related to you degree programme, I'll probably be able to help you with those as well and if not, I can tell you who to contact instead.|||I went through long term illness myself. Seven surgeries in under two years, multiple hospitalizations (both planned and emergency ones), in a wheelchair because I was unable to walk for about 30-40% of those two years, long and painful recovery. It's only since a few months actually that I have been mostly pain free and feel healthy again. I'll give my perspective, as my SO and I are close to your age and also got together when I was 18 years old. You SO will be in pain and feel helpless *a lot*. She needs you to be strong for her, to make her laugh. I think this will require two things of you:1. You need to accept that this is the reality you are dealing with. Accepting this means that you let go of the anger you are feeling and simple start working towards getting through this instead.2. You need to take care of you. You, despite her issues, need to make you a priority. You cannot help her if you are not in a good place yourself. You need therapy, especially considering your already known anxiety issues. You need therapy *right now*. If you break down, your SO will loose her rock. I know I did when my SO had a breakdown during one of my long term hospitalizations and I had to comfort my crying SO, even though I was in pain and high on medications. It was such a tough time to get through.. Your SO needs you and you cannot *afford* for the sake of your SO to be stubborn about not seeing doctor. Then, about what you can do for her (this is where point 1 comes into play): my SO would come visit me every day for 2 hours or so when I was in the hospital. What I wanted most from those 2 hours is to just be with the person I love, to have fun, to laugh and be loved. He would put me in my wheelchair and wheel me to the main lobby. He would race me around the lobby while I held on to my IV lines, while singing stupid songs. All the people looked at us like we were **crazy** and we were. But he got my to laugh and be happy. For those two hours a day when he visited me, we talked about my illness for 10 minutes or so, then we just talked about.. whatever it was we always talk about. This helped more than I can express..That's another thing. As I understand, she has *a lot* of people around her for most of her day. When I was very ill, I could not handle this at all. I needed rest, and sleep, and more rest. I was vocal enough to text my parents when they told me they planned on visiting to stay away that day, because I was too tired. Hell, I even had days when I send my SO home 15-20 minutes into his visit, because I was tired and needed rest. You might want to ask her about it, if she isn't that comfortable discussing this with the people close to her herself.The same goes for you by the way. If it is too much for you to visit her in the hospital all day, every day, you need to tell her. You need to plan **FUN** stuff for you. Go out with friends for a beer, invite some friends over to play some games, anything. Try to keep some stability and normality in your life, despite all of this. You need time to relax, sleep and have fun to be there for her the best you can.|||I retried the game, but they use a very limited sound clip library. Already on the second or third try I started to recognize clips, which made any scores after the first meaningless because I simply linked sound clip to language from memory of previous tries. Wish it had more replayability.|||As a child from divorced parents: you are giving your child something incredibly valuable by staying cordial and kind to his mother. Relationships don't work out, and staying together for the kid is not in the kids best interest. But once your kid grows up and starts to understand the world a bit more, your kid will be incredibly grateful for the support you are giving his mother for his sake. This goes both ways, as Carrie clearly made sure to pay attention to the relationship between you and your son by encouraging him to pick out a wand for you as well. My parents don't have a relationship like that. I'm honestly dreading simply celebrations like my graduation or my wedding, because they can't be cordial to each other, not even for my sake. I'm missing out on a lot of things because of this and many things that ought to bring joy cause quite some sadness and stress. As an adult child of divorced parents, I would give the world to have divorced parents who treat each other like you and Carrie treat each other.|||I assume the 5k is excluding flights from US to EU and back? Anyway, you'll be fine with 5k. I always think it's good to compare your budget to average incomes in the country you're staying. If average income is 3k a month in a specific country, you can quickly understand 5k won't get you far. Anyway, for most eastern EU countries, average income in only a couple of hundred (maybe 500-600?) a month. You'll have about a 1k a month, which would be plenty to cover the additional costs for visiting (trips, staying in hostels etc).|||I'm currently in a class, but a really tiny one: 6 people. It's nice! We have a bit of competition among eachother and have a wechat group together with our teacher where we make the effort to teach other new words we comr across etc. We all suck at the language, so we don't feel ashamed among eachother when speaking and trying out new sentences.|||And the Netherlands.|||You'll easily find jobs with a computer engineering degree, many students in the Netherlands already have a few job options lined up after their bachelors - which *really* is an exception because usually you absolutely need a master to even be considered for a job - however, these students almost always get those jobs through their network. Something which is difficult to build up from the other side of the pond. I think your best shot would be to do a masters degree in the Netherlands, because that way the employers know your educational background and it will give you time to build a network.Do realize however that a masters degree for computer engineering takes 2 years instead of the usual 1 year.|||If it's done and up, will you please let me know/post on this sub again?I'm half Serbian but never learned the language properly. I can understand everything up to B2+ level, but reading (especially in Cyrillic) is difficult and I know zero grammar. I would love to improve on my Serbian, I guess it has become a matter of pride and heritage by now.. but I lack resources because I want to do it independently, instead of asking my family and failing tremendously hard in front of them while I'm still learning the basics.|||Maybe convince her to go to Croatia instead, the Plitvice lakes are in Croatia ;)|||Bring at least one official transscript from your diploma, one which is stamped and dated, not just a photocopy. If you do happen to need one, at least you don't have to wait ages for bureaucracy at your uni to catch up and send it to you.|||Not German myself (Dutch), but my dad grew up in Germany and we speak German sometimes together. In our family 'Ich liebe dich' would be normal way to express love. I mean, I'm not German, but to me 'Ich habe dich lieb' for family sounds weird. That's would you would say to your romantic interest when you just start out, expressing infatuation or something, maybe something like 'Ik vind je leuk' in Dutch in case you know some. That's not by far the kind of deep love I'd feel towards family, so 'Ich liebe dich' for some reasons suits better. But then again, thanks for your input, like I said, I'm not German, so it may very well be weird to say it like that!|||That's actually a really good idea, maybr OP can convince his company to reimburse tuition fees as they can't get his wife a work visa. A EU based diploma will give you a bunch of opportunities across the continent in case you decide to travel some more and you wife gets further specialized education. There'd still be enough time left next to a masters degree to put some decent hours into NGO volunteering. When she's enrolled into a university she might even get access to language learning resources at a highly reduces cost, many unis offer this.|||In the end it's not about having done a prestigious programme and getting some fancy name of you resume, but more about the network you get to build. (Remember: students at Ivies study the same books as everyone else..) Doing your master/phd at a place where the are people with a lot of connections in the field you want to enter would probably be your best bet.|||I don't wrap it over the top, but over the side, so if the projects spans a full page (2 sides to a single paper), I get a piece a washi tape that's long enough to be a header for both pages and I make one continuous header.

She'll probably just answer with a 'uuuh. Ok sure' and you'll give her a happy non judgemental thank you back and that's it. And when she forgets again, you do the same. Dont be passive aggressive, just be honest and straightforward in a non judgemental way.|||Not exactly... in case of primary school you do standardized testing which gives you a score which indicates which 'level' of high school you'd be capable of. In addition to that, you primary school teacher needs to make an evaluation based on their 'professional understanding' of the child learning capabilities. Both need to be in line with each other to go through admission for pre university education. I just happened to have a fucked up, biased teacher.|||I find this a much better argument, as the focus is on the free choice of people, regardless of reason and it can be applied in a way that goes beyond transgenderism, but still can apply to transgenders. And I do agree that if asked about their sexuality or conditions related to sexuality, a transgender person (or someone who is infertile, or really whatever) should answer honestly, because not doing so *is* taking away from informed consent. However, the question still remains whether it is up to the transgender person to openly disclose this information beforehand without being prompted by the other party. To this, I believe the answer is no. If the other party is troubled by certain medical conditions, either transgenderism/infertility/bipolar disorder/number of previous sexual partners/whatever, to the point that based on that point alone, they would reconsider having sex with that person, it also falls on that person to acquire this information from their potential sexual partners.|||Which country are you living in?|||I really have no idea, because I simply don't have any experience with it. But like I said, for your wife you should consider any business that deals with EU/NL-US trade. Either through law firms specializing in helping companies with their trades, or by being part of the company itself. For you I'd start researching whether you need any formal certificates to for example teach in IB programmes, which are super popular at international schools. You can forget about teaching ESL in any formal non-international school setting, as you'll need country specific diplomas. The demand for ESL tutors is low because especially in the Netherlands, most speak English at a relatively (very) high level.|||I think the dynamic between my SO and I is different. We are together for almost 5 years, rent an apartment together, got a cat together. In all ways, we are planning our lives together for the long haul, which will most likely include many expatriations to other sides of the world from where we live, having to depend fully on each other if we do, without help from friends and family. If I'd had to make that same list, he would definitely be on the very top or sharing a first place position.|||Also, if you enter through the UK (or non Schengen zone EEA countries in general), be adviced to check visa requirements for that specific country as well..

No, you don't have to worry about healthcare costs, or saving for your kids university costs, or about getting sick and losing your job, or about needing 3 jobs just to make a living wage, or about maternity leave, or about having holidays in general.... but that all comes at the costs that practically nobody in the country is \\\"rich\\\". For example, OP is in oil and gas and has a 100-140k salary by the time she's 30. I think I will have a similar background (chemical engineering) and I will probably end up in oil and gas as well. My projected salary at 30 years old as an oil and gas engineer will most likely be around 50-60k euros a year, and wouldn't grow that much more in the years after, unless I would go into management, which might add maybe another 10-15k a year. For my country, I would be considered really, *really* rich, especially if my SO would also work and have an 'average' salary of about 20k a year or so. Edit: but at that point you also need to realize that of that 60k a year salary, close to half will be taken away in taxes as well!|||Yup, same for me. The FB connect is a no go. I click away any content that uses my FB as the only login option. Shame though, as I was quite interested in the content.|||You do realize on which sub you are right?

As a follow up, I'd like to mentioned that how I use MBTI actually has a direct relationship to how MBTI can help in organizations. One of your comments was about that MBTI claims to aid in team development, leadership development, conflict management, etc. The thing is, it *does*. Not necessarily by just blindly grouping people together based on their self reported (probably wrong) MBTI types, but if you as a leader are able to relate to the different ways your group members think based on MBTI theory in general, you *are* able to match teams better and to resolve conflicts better.|||How about finding another European university to accept you and go there? You could even pick one based on their studying abroad opportunities, to do your third bachelor year abroad. After your bachelor, just switch to even a new country for your masters.|||I just want to put your 50k figure in perspective: in the Netherlands, the median *household* income is about 35k. Normal families (2 adults, 1.5 children) live from this household income and do just fine. 50k is definitely a luxury position to have, but no, don't expect to live in the centre of Amsterdam but instead in one of the suburbs with a daily commute to work.|||Language would *very* definitely be an issue. In the Netherlands, PT is not a doctorate study, it isn't even a degree studied at university, but at a 'hoge school', higher tertiary professional education. I know in my country, there are a lot of PT students and the market is very tough. But again, without language, I doubt you'd even get a foot in the door. Lots of the work PTs do has to do with elderly people, who very likely will not speak English. They are even more likely to speak their own regional dialect opposed to the 'standard' language of the country. Besides that, most younger people (especially in the more affluent countries) speak English to quite a high level. Why would a local PT office take you on, someone who can only work with a very specific clientele,  opposed to a native who can work with *all* clients.|||I met my BF only weeks after I started in college. He was 24 as well while I was 18. I had the same worries. My BF however was extremely caring *and* careful with me. Constantly checking my boundaries and not initiating anything sexual without my explicit consent. A good 3 years later we are still together and live together. I'm eure this is the guy i'm going to marry. We talk about our age difference sometimes and we both concluded we simply don't realize there is an age gap im daily life, only when consiously thinking about it.It's the man and his personality that counts, not hia age.

In the same time frame, I also needed a major jaw surgery, which could only be done using a general anesthetic of course. Pain management was absolute hell, because the moment I woke up, I was in major pain and it took ages for them to get my pain level managed. I spend over 6 hours (!!) in the post op recovery unit before my pain was at a somewhat manageable level. Even then, the nurses at the ward had great trouble through the night at keeping the pain away. With an epidural, you have a long working sedative that will go away *very* slowly while you gain control of your lower body again. This also means you start with absolutely no pain whatsoever, and can slowly work up the dosage of pain medication once the pain comes back, to keep pain levels really, really low. Feeling paralyzed for several hours sucks big time, but feeling intense pain that doesn't go away sucks even worse.|||I do think it is changing a bit, but it simply so very much ingrained in every part of our culture. We for example have a tiered secondary education system. Only the highest level will grant entry into uni. Students take some type on IQ test at the end of primary school which determines which level of secondary education you get into. It's *very* typical that parents tell their children who fall in between levels to simply do the lower level, because that's just fine as well, why would you push yourself with the risk to fail only to maybe *just* pass the higher level, opposed to having an easier time at a lower level. The same with society at large. Minimum wage is for example about 1500 euros a month. If you would earn 3000+ euros a month, you would be considered quite rich. Salaries over 6000+ euros a month are considered exorbitantly large. The progressive taxing system is great, as it means *everybody* has a very decent and good life quality, but in the same way, it does not reward true excellence. I can think of 10 more examples of how the culture here compares to more 'American Dream' attitude cultures. Same with Dutch feminism: while feminists all over Europe were fighting for equal pay they wanted women to be considered part of the *full time* workforce. In the Netherlands, feminism went after additional governments funds for childcare etc, so women were able to combine childcare and part time jobs. As a result, there are very few women working full time and very few women get into high leadership positions. This really is a different attitude all together.. Now, we see a movement where men are also starting to work part time to combine childcare and career, which I think is great, but again, really points out the classic life path of getting married, have 2.5 children, work a not too hard and ok paying job untill you're 70, fall back on social security for your pensions and enjoy life a bit and travel a bit. Don't get me wrong. The Netherlands is absolutely amazing and I am incredibly proud to be Dutch, but yeah.. it does feel I'm going against the masses with my dreams and ambitions, which is a bit tiresome and at time, even discouraging.|||It is super difficult!

The thing with low calorie diets is that it's totally doable, as long as you can either eat a *lot* of low calorie stofbof a few high calorie things which make you feel full. Pizza does not make you full, that's why we are all able to eat a single 1000+ kcal pizza for dinner and not notice it even if your normal dinner would be less than half of that intake.|||To compare some other figures.I live together with my SO. We spend about 350 euros a month on food and household supplies, we cook super healthy (fresh veggies and fruit), order food once or twice a month, eat meat about 5 days a week (though we eat smaller portions compared to other Dutchies) and my SO is a tall, active guy with an appetite for 2. 350 is *plenty* for all three meals a day. My best friend who is single and vegetarian spends about 90 euros a month on food. Health insurance is about 90-120 euros pp per month. We pay about 100-150 in electricity, water etc for our 1 bedroom.Going to the movies is 20-30 euros for 2 tickets, popcorn and soda. Restaurants (nothing super fancy, just mid range) is 50-70 euros for 2 including drinks. |||My tip: learning language takes years.. even if you only put in 3 hours a week (2 hours lecture + 1 hour) homework and keep that up for a few years it's almost no effort but you'll get *very* far.

I am, and you sum up my reason to not call myself a feminist (any longer). I want no association with the 'feminist warrior' type which, sadly, seems to be characterizing new wave feminism. Also, although I believe classic feminism is still very much relevant and needed in many parts of the world, in the Western world I think we are beginning to face issues which go beyond feminism and are more egalitarian in nature. In this sub I dare even go as far as to say that I believe that if feminism will continue to have such a dominant position in western society, it will hurt society in terms of growing gender *in*equality for men. We are already seeing this happen, the trends show more than 50% of women getting degrees in higher education as many men drop out, and it isn't stopping any time soon. I believe these issues are mainly due to 'feminisation' of what we consider good education, an inherent bias towards women. A similar topic is family law.|||Racetracks sound awesome! Great idea. You are changing the world single-handed, one dad and one daughter at the time. :)|||FOR THE LOVE OF YOUR CHILD (!!) LEAVE THIS WOMAN. My parents had a similar situation like you are in and please, *please* if not for yourself, your daughter needs to have a stable home. My parents divorced when I was 12 and it left both completely bankrupt be at least there was *peace*. Within a few years after the divorce I opted to stay at my dad full time because (and this is what you need to understand) the way my mother treated me was abusive. Just like **your wife is abusing your daughter right now**. You owe it to your daughter to safe her from this situation, even if you don't want to safe yourself.|||The fact that your able to rationally break up events and are trying to analyze them, while willing to receive feedback and criticism tells me you'll be just fine. You just need more experience..If I can give you one tip, try finding yourself a senior female in your field with whom you click. A female who can be a role model and a sort of mentor. She will also help you to give you direct feedback on these kind of social issues. Maybe once you get to know him better, you could ask that older guy you met about this and ask if he can introduce to some women that might fit the bill? But again, get to know the man a bit better first before you start asking.|||Define 'understood'. I have 2 super highly ambitious friends, who I talk future plans with and who get my own drive (both not TYPE_MENTION though funnily enough, but they do get my TYPE_MENTION mindset).I have 1 super motherly, and kind friend, who I call if I need some emotional support and validation. With her, I feel super save being totally vulnerable. She sometimes randomly drops by when I feel sad to have lunch with me and she brings croissants and chocolate. I love that girl.And I have a couple (4-5) friends I've known for ages and I enjoy their company, but they don't know me like the other 3 do, but they all accept me for the rational, hyper analytical 'bitch' I am. To be fair, I also put a lot less energy in my relationship with these friends compared to the other 3. And then there is my boyfriend. He is an TYPE_MENTION. He's just perfect. Sometimes I think he actually knows me better then I know myself.. at the very least he certainly knows how to deal with me. My friends all know different facets of me and my character. My boyfriend knows me how I am as a whole person and loves me for it, that's why he's perfect above all others.The thing is: it's important to have all kinds of different relationships with people, because each relationship has a different purpose. No single person can fulfill all your emotional needs.|||I'm guessing a big part of it is that simply owning a shell company isn't illegal if properly documented at your country's IRS and the appropriate taxes are paid. With the Panama Papers the whole shell company construct is under scrutiny and deemed wrong and illegal by the general public. The leak is a massive database of a shitload of people simply owning shell companies, not a list of people who pursue illegal activities through those shells. Having a searchable database wil condemn a lot of people in the eye of the public who are innocent of illegal activities.|||It wasn't until I broke my ankle I realized how *important* shoes are for not only your feet, but practically every joint in your body. For my specific injury, my doctor actually advised me to wear heels as much as possible, so I get your struggle. Frankly, the solution is quite simple. Wear *high quality* shoes. I only wear leather now a days with thick, sturdy soles. The thing is, high quality shoes are expensive. My shoes are usually around 150 euros (and 250 for boots) at full retail price, but I also noticed you can get *amazing* deals that take 50-70% off if you know your brands and take your time to shop around and be willing to wait. Some of my favourites: Panama Jack, Pikolinos, Timberland. If you google these brands, you'll see that they are mostly known for their typical mounting climbing shoes as I call them. But if take the time to look around, they actually have some work appropriate models as well, but with the same comfort and sturdiness of their mountain shoes.|||My mentor/older friend is a physics professor who is in her 50s, she has the most perfect typical older English lady wardrobe, including the pearls and everything. When I first got to know her she told me how she explicitely refuses to wear trousers when she goes to meetings or needs to give lectures. It's her way of breaking stereotypes with the younger generation, because damn it, she's a woman and damn proud of that fact. It struck a cord with me and with the exception of labs of course, I do the same. I have a wardrobe full of 50s inspired hyper feminine clothes (think Joan of Mad Men, just a bit toned down). It's really funny how this fucks up the minds of sexist men. I have a rather dominant personality and a very masculine way of approaching meetings and problems. Sexist men (especially those who don't know me very well) can't handle seeing someone being dominant in a body conscious dress.|||Is your big company a multinational? If yes, have a chat with HR to see if they have relocation options, many multinationals do and this might be b6 far the easiest way as HR will take care of everything.|||Something Oprah Winfrey once said really stuck with me. It was something like 'if I had children either my career or the children would suffer... and it won't be my career'. That's spot on how I feel about having kids.|||Nah, at my uni you can already become a TA at the end of undergrad if you're a strong student, although you can only teach the first and in some cases second years. And in my country, everybody gets their masters degree to begin with, as its the standard and without you'll be unemployable. That changes the dynamic a bit as well.|||Really? I didn't know this! And yes, you actually made me quite curious to see a comparison between the two. Maybe you can find me a course overview for let's say chemical engineering (program I'm rather familiar with when it comes to European higher education) of a college you consider representative for US engineering bachelors?|||If you both want to get a PhD position I suggest to first find one for the person with the education degree. The amount of PhD positions a uni has is directly linked to their funding and there is a lot more money is STEM compared to humanities.. If the person with the education is degree is willing to forgo the PhD degree you might want to drive a hard bargain and find a uni that's willing to put some resources in the spouse in the form of a partner programme, either by giving this person a job (which probably won't be a PhD) at the university itself - which is very unlikely though for a PhD position - or by providing resources such as free languages courses and other training etc.|||Do you do all your homework and all practise exercises? Have you always done this in the past?*Understanding* something that is *conceptually* hard is something different than being able to actually be able to work through a specific sort of problem yourself or be able to reproduce certain techniques etc.For the first, you need intelligence, for the second, you need practise and hard work.|||What kind of gatekeepers are you thinking of? Secretaries/personal assistants who control the execs/managers agendas are a whole different type of gatekeeper than.. a communications officer who decides what and how stuff gets published through company channels on behalf of execs/managers. Both are independent actors that have a clear gate keeping function (although very different ones), and would probably need different approaches.|||Seeing you post made me log in to my health insurance system to see what my medical costs were. I injured myself badly 2.5 years ago. I needed 7 surgeries and several (some long term) hospitalizations because of it over the course of 2 years. I payed I think about 2000 euros a year, because I took out additional insurance for physical therapy and extended physical recovery support. In the Netherlands, you can readjust your coverage every year, as coverage runs for a full calendar year. I was injured around christmas, so that got me the option to get additional insurance for expected costs. In the Netherlands, by law, no insurance company may turn away someone based on existing injuries, or adjust the price of their (basic) insurance options based on existing injuries.  Total costs for those 7 surgeries, hospital stays, medication etc etc was billed to my insurer at about 27k euros (~30k dollars). The thing is, besides that the US has issues with their healthcare insurance options, they also have issues with how healthcare is priced. Basic health care services are billed far, far higher in the US than any other developed country.|||Assuming you are US (or western EU) based and your post FIRE budget is based on the US COL, did you consider making extensive traveling a major goal on your life? It would be for me.What I would do, is for example travel 2-3 months a year to south east Asia, Africa etc. COL is so dramatically reduced compared to US/EU in countries in those regions, you'll easily save a few thousands in costs by living there for a couple of months. Those savings can be put towards additional travels in higher COL countries.Additional tip: eastern Europe! Beautiful, still has a 'western' feel to it, and cost of living can easily be &lt;800 euros a month.|||I do wonder, not that you should necessarily take this route, but I know my country actually has laws to prevent exactly this which states all children are to receive similar treatment and gains. In my country you could actually sue your parents for your share of their money they denied you by given it all to your sib. Like I said, maybe not the way to go, but considering the high amount of money we're talking about, it could be interesting to look into it|||Same on each point mentioned.|||I think before I started to develop my empathy (or COGFUNC_MENTION side of things) I was really focused on the output and quality of somebody's work. I had high standards, which everybody who wanted to work with me knew about, and I would really demand those standards being met from everybody in my team, and it would be your problem to deal with any issues that caused subpar work. But now, I try to judge output quality by taking personal situations into account. If somebody has been ill or has had an emotional tough time, I will be less judgmental and will work with that person to help them through and deliver. And I think I've been doing a really good job at this, because I find people approach me often and early when they are facing issues to discuss what's going on in their life and how **we** are going to solve the problem. But I'm still ruthless to people who deliver sub par work without good reason.Real life management situation:I'm part of a management team. An employee has been trying to switch functions in our organization by doing some additional (paid) part time work on top of the regular job to get some experience. Employee has been doing this for the past couple of years. Somebody else in the management team is responsible for this employee. So now, a few years later, this employee delivers their final piece of work on which employee has been working on all that time and due to stress of having two jobs, employee said that either the team makes him/her full time employee for this new function quitting the old function or he/she will quit doing this new function (which is not easily replaced) and will only do the old function.The work employee delivered was crap. Manager of this employee has been utter crap in guiding employee through this, and employee has no idea about the work being crap and things the work is actually really good enough to do this work full time. However.. the employee put an ultimatum out and now we need to make a decision. The manager of employee suggested we give in to the ultimatum and just get employee to do the new function, finding somebody else to do the old job. While knowing this employee would be replaced in maybe a year because quality is so low and at that point, employee wouldn't be able to go back to the old job. I became ANGRY, so incredibly angry at my colleague because frankly, yes, work is sub par, but it was not the fault of that employee the mangagement team was now put in a crap situation. This was due to crap management, and frankly, I refused to let employee suffer the consequences for sub par work caused by a situation not really caused by employee.. This was my empathy kicking in. Because human lives should be treated with dignity and yes, if somebody functions badly, they need to go, but if they function badly because somebody else fucked up, they don't deserve to go. Judging in which situations somebody is or isn't at fault is my empathetic judgement speaking.|||I use one week views together with a month log all in the spirit of constant migration of tasks and events.On of my most important BuJo uses is to keep track of deadlines and upcoming meetings and to plan prep work accordingly. So, I uses the traditional 'o' designation to put events under a certain day in my weekly and dots to designate tasks. I only plan one week at the time, so I need my monthly to keep track of meetings, deadlines and other events that I know of in advance. So all my 'o' events are in my monthly and once I get around to prepping my new week I migrate all my 'o' events from my monthly to weekly.|||If it helps: I'm 21 in a 3 year relationship with the man I'm sure I want to marry. I love him, completely, fully, with all my heart. He is beyond compare amazing. But if for some reason we would break up now, I am certain I will find another man who would be just as amazing as him although it would take time of course. There is not a 'one true love' for you or anyone. Love in my opinion is also to a large extent a choice. You choose to see a certain person as the man or woman to be with the rest of your life, this does not mean that person is the *only* one to choose from. Also, I want you to consider something else: Think back at how much you changed between 15 years old and 18. And again how much between 18 and 21. This wil not change for another 10 years or so. This is why many relationships will not last at our age, many simply grow apart. The only reason I believe I will marry my SO is because from day 1 when I was 18 and he was 23 we talked about our futures, about our dreams and ambitions and we concluded are goals and ambitions lined up almost perfectly and started to work together towards that future. Over the next 3 years we changed and developed *together*. Considering you've been lying to your GF about some very very fundemental things over the past 1.5 years, I honestly doubt this is the case with you. If you think you might stay with this girl, you should start considering your future together and discuss openly and honestly whether your goals for the next 5 years line up, but also your ambitions for the next 10 or even 20 years. And of course, this might change over time, that's only natural, but only if you change together as a unit (the two of you against the world), will a relationship at our age work out long term.|||My parents tell me I was born this way and always acted like I do now. I like to think it's nature, with only a bit of nurture. My parents are an TYPE_MENTION dad and an TYPE_MENTION mum. Needless to say, I was quite the daddy's girl and did nothing but fight with my mum my whole childhood.|||I always had a difficult relationship with my mum (and dad). When I bonded with my in laws, especially my MIL, a world opened up and I finally understood what being a good parent meant, even once the kids were all grown up.If anything, open up to your MIL and just tell the woman how moved you were by her support. It will make her happy and care for you even more, and you'll get a better bond with an additional parent figure who clearly cares for you and loves you.|||I disagree with life being a 'gift' from the parents, because basically, I had no say in being born, and was not granted the opportunity to decline the gift like I could have as an autonomous person in your other examples such as with organ donations. I could *choose* not to accept the gift of organ donation and therefor the gift of expended life span and die instead if that is what I prefer. However, being alive was *forced* upon me. Something cannot be a gift the accepting party cannot deny it.Having a child is a 100% selfish choice on the part of the parents. Think about it, when you ask people why they want or already have children the answer always starts with 'I wanted'. I wanted a legacy, I wanted someone to love, I wanted a child to take care of me wheb I'm old. While objectively, considering over population and al related problems, bringing even more people in this world is the worst decision you can make with regard to prosperity of mankind. But people still have children to fulfill their own selfish needs.That's where the whole argument of the premise comes from. We all are entitled to basic human needs because none of us chose to be in this position to begin with and it was forced upon us. The idea that parents need to provide for this is because of the train of thought that they are the ones that decided they wanted children and they should be responsible for their choices. However, in practice we see that this is very often not the case or circumstances change during the life time of the child. This is why I believe government is solely resposible in providing basic human needs, based on the idea that we are all in this shit together and nobody of us asked for it.|||Google 'IND' which stands for 'Immigratie en Naturalisatie Dienst' or the immigration and naturalization department. Their site is also available in English and gives all information, laws and regulations of immigrating to the Netherlands, both for foreigners and expatriates.|||Suffering is a big word. But no, I do not mind being *uncomfortable*. When I'm home, I wear nothing else but pajamas. To me, there is nothing more comfortable. At work, I wear the most amazing pencil skirts and dresses. In my country, everybody uses their bike to travel. Ever tried riding a bike with a pencil skirt? Exactly. Also, I'll be wearing nice, tight stockings and good corrective underwear with those outfits. Heeled shoes to match.Compared to my pajamas, my daily outfit is nothing but uncomfortable, but it does give me great joy and pleasure to know I look great and to feel rather stunning while walking around the halls of my office. I may be uncomfortable as fuck and my feet might hurt when I get home, but it's worth it when it means I feel confident and amazing.|||That is hardly an explanation. Sad. I expected more.|||Tough choice, not too much input from my side. But, I've picked up two things from your post: 1. You want to get foreign nationalities one day, I'd say look into to requirements for naturalization in both countries. Be wary however that doing so in many cases requires you to give up your current nationality. (But that's not the case in all countries)2. You say you want to travel a lot and being able to travel is important to you two. If you want to get your foreign nationality you'll probably be bound the that place for quite a *looong* time before you're eligible for naturalization. You might want to consider what your travel ambitions are and which country would provide the best home base. For example, both Sydney and London have amazing airports which fly to practically everywhere. However, visiting Asia and I think even the Americas will probably less expensive from Sydney, will traveling Europe, the Middle East and many parts of Africa will be quicker and cheaper from London.|||You realize why your mum is doing this right? Roseanne is a 20 year younger version of her, with the same 'values' and gossipy behaviour. Your mum likes Roseanne better because she recognizes herself in her, and is bitching on you because you are doing things your own way and not following her example.Set boundaries and shut it down. Don't allows your mother to criticize your parenting. Simply tell her you won't put up with her, don't JADE and once she starts, simply hang up the phone, literally walk away from her or tell her she needs to leave.. and again while you're doing so, don't JADE.|||You will most likely not get into a university with a nursing bachelor. Of course nursing is a reconized degree in the EU, but usually they are taught at universities of *applied science* and not regular universities. These applied science institutions provide the more hands on higher education. For example, nursing, PT, small business, accounting, etc. Usually these istitutions only provide bachelor level education, although some masters are provide, it's pretty rare.Anyway, to get into a university master programme you need a university bachelor programme in *a closely related field*. This is a big difference compared to the US. Like, if you did an English literature bachelor, you can't enrol for a law master, you'd need a law bachelor. The only exception is when you have a bachelor in a *somewhat* related field, as in those cases, you might take an additional year of education doing bachelor courses that allow entry to a specific master, for example if you have a bachelor in psychology and want to do a master in HRM.|||Except he wouldn't be cohabitating as his GF will not leave her parental home untill married?|||On question 1:Wanting to not exist is not the same as wanting to die. If I look at myself for example, I see absolutely no reason for me to exist in relationship to mankind and if given the choice I rather have never been born. However, that was not a choice that was mine to make, now that I do exist I do not want to die. On question 2:This is a legal thing, many countries have a certain age from which the child needs to consent to medical treatment, in my country this age is 12 but could be earlier if the doc concluded the mental capabilities of the patient are comparable to those of age of consent. This really differs between countries though.|||Wouldn't it be *easier* in that case to have friends without children? Because then both friends to to drag along their kids or make arrangements.|||Stepmother is 39, not the yougest either. On your second question, I am leaning towards yes as in the end, the grandparents are by far too old and the only other family member around is my fathers sisters. I don't like that woman as she is a totally unfit mother, always jealous of other peoples success and continously bragging about her own kids at he expense of others. Im not letting that child end up in her hands. In any case,  if this scenario plays out I don't expect it to do so in de early years of the childs life,  so the worst part will not be on my plate (I'm not good with young children).What worries me most is how laid back my dad is about all of this. I'm probably giving this situation more thought than my father.|||Yeah, I do this often with friends who throw the 'I have nothing to hide' ball at me, so just for the sake of doing a little experiment, I set a timer on 10 minutes and tried to google OP's name to see what popped up. What I found was (I'll keep it very generic for her privacy's sake): she has a blog, instagram, and other social media related to bullet journalling. But in those 10 minutes I was also able to find out which country and city she lives in, get pictures of (I'm guessing) her kids, find out what kind of car she drives, and found out that she has certain eating habits, and several names of family members. Imagine what I could find if I was stalker and actually was willing to put in several hours of work and go through all her post histories, looking for specific details to get more data from.. I feel like I already have enough data to be able to track OP down in real life with the help of a bit of social engineer if I was living in her city.I think this in general is also a warning for people who post here. I *love* seeing all the bullet journals, but at times, I also see people post quite sensitive info which they wrote down in their journals.|||If you are having trouble getting your point across, maybe you should just show her this thread to see how people outside of the situation look at it. It may help convince her.|||So for me.. I felt like this at the end of my teenage years.. feeling lost and not doing anything in life. The trick was to just keep pushing myself to do new things and talk to new people and just experience what makes other people tick and excited. At some point you are bound to come across people and their ideas that excite you or make you angry or sad, simply *anything* that sparks an emotional reaction that tells you 'YES, this is something I want to focus on'. And then it's just an issue of unleashing the full COGFUNC_MENTION/COGFUNC_MENTION power on it, which we are born to do.I think both TYPE_MENTION and TYPE_MENTION are really two sided: either they have a goal to unleash COGFUNC_MENTION/COGFUNC_MENTION on and they thrive, or they don't and all that energy turns inward and makes us melancholic.|||From OP's post: See will definitely need a visa, for example the non-EEA family member visa. What you are hinting on is the visa-free travel agreement between the EU and the US, which allows US citizens to travel visa-free in the Schengen zone. However, this is *only* for up to 90 days every so many months. A visa is not *just* an entry document, but also tells you the restrictions to remain in or exit the country.Visa's can also very well allow you to work, for example, the non-EEA family visa does this, and you'll get a *residence card* but not necessarily get a *residence permit* (those are different things at least in my country).When OP enters the EU, she can choose how she wants to enter, either on the visa-free US-EU agreement rules, or on the non-EEA family member visa, but you can't switch which visa you're using when you are *already* in the Schengen zone, as you'll passport will be registered to the visa/agreement you entered with. If you want to switch, you need to exit and reenter the Schengen zone all over again.|||One of the biggest pros with Moleskine is its availability. Leuchtturm is practically nowhere to be found in my country, while Moleskine is sold by every medium sized and larger bookstore. Being able to pick up and buy a notebook within 20 minutes from wherever you are is a really big plus, especially if the alternative is ordering the Leuchtturm online and paying an additional 3-5 euros in shipping.|||Eehm... You sure you are Dutch? Every reasonably sized grocery store will have two milk sections: refrigerated (with most likely yoghurts, 'vla' and dairy desserts next to the milk) and unrefrigerated ('houdbare melk' in Dutch, with most likely chocolate milk and 'drink yoghurt' and such next to it).|||I think it is important to see your BuJo as separate from your agenda.I have my agenda in which I actually plan my meetings, while my BuJo is a weekly/daily to do. Agenda is the 'to go' place, BuJo is 'to do' place.I have a layout that has a week to a double page (each individual day + some space for weekly to do), and that way I can plan many weeks up front. I also have a monthly log at the beginning of that months weekly logs.If something is a specific to do for a certain day, in goes as a bullet point on that day, if it's something that needs to be done in a certain week or somewhere this month, it goes either in the weekly to do or monthly to do.So, this way you could bullet journal 'plan meeting with X' whenever you need to plan your meeting weeks ahead and then record the actual meeting in your agenda.|||This line perfectly sums up why I find so much peace in nihilism (I'm an TYPE_MENTION by the way).If there is no meaning everything is fair game and wanting to live on a lonely coconut island is just as valid and true of a goal in life as becoming a CEO of a multinational company. It is somehow the ultimate mindset to simply do that thing everyday that you for some reason feel its worthwhile to get out bed for. Without judgement call. Without having to ask yourself whether what you do is 'right' or whether or not you are wasting your life or whether you are good enough to deserve life, because there is no right or true way to live life if it is in essence meaningless.|||Oops, I stand corrected. Coming back to OP's reaction on my comment I didn't bother to reread his post, and somehow had it in my mind that he/she enrolled for IRIO. So sorry OP, but sadly, Clio isn't your study associations.

If you don't, this discussion is useless.|||Coming from somebody who is studying at a uni where they research sleeping cycles and shit: you need to start accepting whatever your own biological clock tells you, because trying to shift in biorhythms will always have an adverse effect in the long run. Most people notice a natural shift over several decades, but even then the shift is minimal. Your biological clock has two main variables: number of sleeping hours needed and the times when you need sleep.Seriously, I have met people who needed 10 hours of sleep every day, but who also had a very time shifted rhythm, meaning they had the biggest troubles falling asleep before 2 o clock at night. They simply couldn't. That's the definition of shitty genetics really.If you need 8 hours, that is totally normal and reasonable. So give your body those 8 hours daily, because if you don't you'll be paying it with your general health and your achievements will suffer for it.|||Cant you get generics? 20 bucks sounds a lot, I pay maybe 5 euros a month!|||A double engineering degree for my bachelor's. Being an engineer really does not suit my TYPE_MENTION mindset, though I am intrigued by tech and industry. I decided I want to get into engineering management, so I'm going to get a masters degree in both engineering fields, and tag on an additional business administration masters degree.|||I 've been thinking a lot about your comments the last day (thanks a lot again!). One last question, as I don't want to keep bothering you.. what stops a rando from not starting a fork every other day and immensely disrupting the network? I'm guessing there must be some infrastructural (hardware) support if you want to get a fork. Is that the issue? That essentially both blockchains (2X and BTC) both run on the same network and the network 'hosts' both forks? Who decides that that may happen (again, what is stopping a rando)?|||It's the maximum 'mandatory' deductible, yes, you can get a higher 'voluntary' deductible, but that will also give you a discount on the monthly payments. I'm guessing though that somebody with a known medical condition would probably not choose to get a higher voluntary deductible.|||You'll be fine with any STEM related field. However, what you should consider if you want to work in industry (opposed to academia) you'll most likely need to learn the local language. And be rather good at the language as well. Again, same advice I always give to Americans about coming to Europe: you *will* need a masters degree.. In general, a bachelors degree only - unlike the US - is usually not considered enough to be hired on a academic level. You might want to consider doing your masters degree in Europe after you're done with your bachelors.|||I must disagree. If OP is anything like myself on this topic, having a partner who is willing to travel and relocate is a non-negotiable. Some people just feel the need to get away from wherever they are and will move mountains to do so and make sacrifices for it. These people will also never be happy in their life without being able to travel.To say 'hey, don't break up with someone just because they don't want to relocate and you do' would be the same as saying 'hey, don't break up with someone just because they don't want children and you do'. A fundamental difference in life priorities.|||I remember an article in one of our national newspapers about happiness of different groups of people (kids/no kids, single/relationship). Young couples without kids (20-30 yo) were absolutely significantly the happiest. Followed by couples with kids older than 12, with just behind them couples without children aged 30-65. Couples with children under the age of 12 were very much more unhappy compared to even the group without children, aged 30-65. I guess I made a back of the envelope calculation which showed me the decrease in happiness for 12 years only to get a tiny gain in the years after really don't weigh up to a constant degree of happiness of not having kids.|||Tell your parents.

Banding together out of superiority feelings and wanting to 'proof' that superiority in how we run our faction as well. It's not pretty, but I do think this is a very real reality for TYPE_MENTION society based sociology.|||This is why although I really, *really* enjoyed BB, I still like the DS series more.

I'm learning Mandarin because of 'business' reasons. I want to work at large multinationals (management most likely) in the tech or industrial sector. China is a huge market for these companies. I keep hearing people argueing not to study Chinese unless your job specifically calls for it, but frankly, I do not ever expect to use my Chinese in a formal situation (legal issues, having meetings in Chinese etc), yet I do consider Mandarin extremely valuable from a business perspective. I come from a very international background, was raised multilingual and have been in contact with a lot of different cultures throughout my life (thanks mom and dad!). I've noticed that language strongly influences the way people communicate, even when using a third shared language to communicate. Even when considering rather similar cultural backgrounds, you'll notice a German will use English very differently than.. let's say a Grecian or Italian. EVEN if they are all considered C2 level fluent (although you'd notice it less due to shear exposure to the target language and they've learned to adapt to it). Anyway, to me, communication is much less about formal and correct language use, and much more about making a shared connection and actually.. you know.. communicating whatever it is your trying to get across. I'm only at HSK3 and I already notice I've improved so much in my communication with Chinese people, because I started to really get a feeling for the way they are using their English, and how their Chinese cultural/linguistic background is shaping their English. Even though I am C2 certified, I'll adjust my English to whatever target group I'm speaking with. I expect to work a lot with Chinese people during my 'business career', and if knowing a bit of Mandarin wil help me communicate better with my Chinese counterparts it will very definitely be worth it, even if we won't use Chinese.Oh, and by the way. It's really nice when you're doing a project and your teammates can't gossip behind your back as they very damn well know you can understand whatever it is they are discussing. That's competitive advantage right there.|||Then go. Really, you have nothing to lose. Worst case: it doesn't work out in Sweden and you'll be just a train ride and a flight away from home.|||I think this will be burried, but here it goes: I'm a female engineering student with a lot of friends in the CS department. I think the main reason is the lack of exposure in high schools. There are very little ways to gently force female students to even *know* what CS is about. If you don't know about it, you also can't see it as something you might enjoy, especially because CS is difficult to get into fully on your own without outside support. Second, there is still a lot of sexism towards women who want to go into STEM in general, but it's very, *very* subtle. No school will tell their female students that they shouldn't do STEM because they're girls, but still you'll see teachers subtly steering them away from STEM by how they approach girls vs boys. It's unconscious sexism. This happens both at school *and* at home, which is also a problem. Practically all STEM girls I know have hyper supportive parents who consiously made the effort from a young age to break stereotypes to their daughters.And now the third point, which I think is most interesting. Our faculty has had a long history of offering CS, but since a couple of years also offer a degree in Artificial Intelligence. They have the same basic set of courses but the specialization courses differ. Here's the thing: CS is promoted like regular CS, while AI is promoted as a study that's relevant to all kinds of social issues. CS has only 1 or 2 girls starting each year, while AI as 30% girls!|||Have a [look](http://www.rug.nl/bachelors/artificial-intelligence/?lang=en)! AI is offered next to CS and although they of course have overlapping content and courses, AI isn't just a specialization of a CS bachelor, but a full stand alone bachelor degree. They also offer a corresponding AI master programme.|||Just to let you know, but with the midori, you get an extra band that keeps the notebook closed. Most use them as a band to hold notebooks together. With just that single band, you can already fit 3 inserts. I think for neither Midori or the Sojourner it will really comfortably fit more than 3. I know people fit 4, but after 4, it gets a bit too bulky to handle.|||I made the same calculation, and figured, it wasn't worth it actually considering your personal circumstances. The chances to get through 3 years without needing specialist care, especially if you're doing extreme sports, are very low. And besides the deductible, you'll also face additional costs.. For example, the people who consider getting the deductible discount will very likely also not have any additional insurance. If OP would break a leg, they would be out ~300 euro's extra on the deductible, but also an additional ~600 euros for the first 20 physical therapy sessions (after that, basic insurance kicks in for chronic injury) and another 100-200 euro's for recovery equipment (crutches), unexpected expenses like additional food cost because of mobility issues, etc.. etc.. etc.. it's expensive to get ill, and a lot of expenses are kind off 'ghost' expenses which you really don't think of and don't really realize are happening. Been there, done that, I think I have made a total of 15-20k billed medical costs in the last couple of years because of one stupid, unexpected fall due to extreme sports. I was a student at the time, and if you are suddenly expected to pay an additional 1-2k euros extra when you don't have an income, those 300 euros more or less matter, especially considering the stress serious illness causes you, even without financial worries.  Then again, if you are liquid enough to be able to cover the costs, it might be cheaper, yes, if you remember to readjust your plan the year after for the lower deductible because you *will* need after care and check ups if something shit happens that may span a year or two after the initial injury (or even 3-5 years if you're unlucky like me).|||And an top of that, no issue with having to give up vacation days when you get sick or whatever, because most EU countries have laws that protect ill workers from being fired and requiring the employer to keep paying them a salary when I'll.|||What are your reasons for being outside? I think this is relevant, because the activity will also determine your options. But, frankly, the best advice is to stay in the shade or indoors (especially during midday) and simply try to prevent as much sun exposure as possible. Do keep applying sunscreen though for those short trips to and from the car or bike rides, but really try to think about ways of limiting those as well to prevent getting caught by to much direct sunlight.|||In the Netherlands, students live on their own and are fully independent. This means they cook, clean, get groceries etc on their own. Sure, most students live in student housing, meaning they share a house with a couple of other students, and also share a kitchen, but mostly you'll be independent. A student house usually cooks and eats food together maybe once or twice a week, but usually everyone cooks their own food. This also means you'll be responsible for finding your own housing. The university is very clear: they are responsible for your education, not to cater to your every life whim, as they have better things to do. The same goes for lunches. Yeah, you can get food at the canteens, but it gets expensive really fast. In the Netherlands, students usually take sandwiches, fruit or leftover dinner with them to the uni for lunch. |||Not exactly sure what you're looking for, but the /etc/fstab for the same USB stick I installed my OS from is:     overlay / overlay rw 0 0    tmpfs /tmp tmpfs nosuid,nodev 0 0    /dev/sda3 swap swap defaults 0 0When going to any of the TTY's when Unity has crashed I get    &lt;devicename&gt; login: But when entering my username I don't even get the usual password propmt during a Unity crash and it goes straight to error codes.

The US actually spends the most on healthcare of all the OECD countries (more or less all the developed countries) but quality of care, waiting times, or the number of medical staff per patient are about similar to other high performing countries who spend far less..Yes, of course, if you actually have to money, you could buy yourself the best care in the world if you are in the US, while in the Netherlands, you couldn't as all people, rich or poor, are pushed through the same gatekeeping system, which is the sole reason why costs are kept so low. And yes, the US medical universities do offer some of the best and most cutting edge research in the world.. but if you look at the differences in systems and availability of medical care for just a common working class person, you are quite fucked in the US, which again, is ridiculous considering how much money the US spends on healthcare!|||That's a good point. You see the same in small countries, even mine (the Netherlands) where over the distances of like 300 km two people speaking exclusively in their respective dialects wouldn't be able to understand each other.

They all come from the north, and were raised in Mandarin and all were university educated, but I do notice quite a few differences between them. I do imagine though that those differences will get smaller when the urbanization and (global) connectivity continues, especially considering.. well.. that it's China and they do have a way in forcing these kind of transitions which lead to super fast adoption.|||You should discuss this during a moment when everybody's emotions are stable. First and foremost, you need to explain to your partner that being a 'fixer' is simply a *big* part of your personality and that it will be difficult to change your behaviour, that you will absolutely try, but that it will be a bit of a struggle for you and you wil need your SOs help to learn how to approach these situations better.I had this discussion with my SO myself. For us, what really helps:I approach him with the Socratic method: ask questions. This allows my SO to feel like they are the one filling in the conversation and leaves you to still be able to stear the solution. 'So, you feel upset with what person X did. What do you think is needed to resolve the situation', 'Do you think that's going to happen?', 'How do you feel about telling person Y about this, maybe he can talk to person X' etc.Instead of the typical TYPE_MENTION: 'This is what's needed to resolve this situation' talk.Besides this, we have another big agreement. My SO often feels I push and dig too hard during these conversations when he is done talking about it and just want to hug and be together. I am god awful at recognizing this feeling. I just can't. So I told him I need his help in recognizing when it's been enough. He agreed that at any time in our more emotional conversations, he can hold up his hand like a stop sign and I'll shut up immediately and either we just sit and hug a bit in silence or change the subject completely.|||I doubt a Dutch university is attainable for her. As a rule of thumb, Dutch unis require about 4-5 AP classes for incoming US undergrads, usually even APs in a relevant field for the degree you want to pursue. Maybe she'll have more luck with applied science schools, but even that will be tricky with those grades.(I read your blog, fine arts is definitely a degree that's more or less outside of the scope of minimum grades and such, and depend much more on portfolios and auditions to get in, most 'regular' degrees are pretty cut and dry for their entrance criteria.)|||I'm also at the woods with my first playthrough of the game and I'm finding it really easy up till now. It's taking for ever, yes, but that's more because of the 'oh shit, another x0k in blood echos.. let's cash them in before continuing'. Anyway, I'm using a skill character with the whip/cane as weapon. The whip form makes this area a joke. The reach of the whip is far enough that any snake or snakehead can't reach you when it tries to attack you but you can reach them. Easy kills all over the place.|||Regardless of med school, you'll need a student visa. For Germany, you'll have to show you'll have sufficient funds (Finanzierungsnachweis), for most students, this means showing immigration a bank statement which shows a balance of about 9k euros or more. You'll likely have to show you have sufficient funds every year. There are other options, for example, if your parents are willing to provide proof that they'll support you financially, but simply showing you have the required amount in cash is easiest.For jobs, I think you'll be fine provided your B.A. in German got you a proper proficiency level (a proper C1 proficiency should do it). As long as you'll speak the language you won't have any more difficulties to get a job compared to regular citizens, because your student visa will allow you to work a small amount of hours every week so no issue there for employers.

In Europe, your degree is worth close to nothing without a masters degree, as there are little to no job opportunities with only a BSc. Most engineering MSc degrees are 2 year programmes, of which you spend the second year mostly doing research, finishing with a final master thesis. Also, in Europe, you can only do a PhD programme after you obtained your masters degree, there graduate programmes which combine masters and PhD as I see US based people talk about often is really uncommon here (although they do exist). And yes, although most start their PhD straight after their MSc (which can be at their alma mater or another uni), there are people who start off in industry and after a few years come back to academia, using their old profs for connections. I'm guessing you're US based, but I did want to put it out there.. maybe you'd even like to cross the pond and do a PhD here in some years. In any case, I think it's good to include these regional differences in these discussions.|||Back again with a few questions: I decided to get my ears pierced and found two piercing shops in my city that - according to online reviews - have a good reputation. I wanted to go visit them and have a look for myself if they are any good. Any particular questions I should ask to judge whether the piercer actually knows what he's doing? Also, as I understand, after you pierced your ears you need to keep your 'starter set' earrings in 24/7 for a number of weeks. I was wondering what typical 'starter sets' would look like and if you have any advice. My google searches don't seem to help me a lot and only give me hits for earbuds meant for small children.|||I do this too!

My mum is not like your ex, but she is a narcissist so although not equal, it was a similar situation.

You actually never hear the *good* parents make this argument, you know, the people who were born to raise children themselves and have an intrinsic motivation to do so.|||So, what you'll see in many European countries is that the high school curriculum is rather complex. Many countries have different 'levels' of highschool with varying degree of difficulty of which only the highest level high school diploma will allow entry to university. On top of that, you'll have to choose the right courses at high school to get into your degree of choice. For example in my country, most engineering degrees would demand a high level mathematics course and probably physics. Essentially.. everyone who enters university has done 6 years of AP classes to make somewhat of a comparison with the US. When it comes to science pre-reqs, this means most of it is already covered during high school. General calculus, diffeq, physics, etc etc. This means less time is needed at university to build up these skills. I'm a Chemical Engineering, I only did Calculus 1 and Linear Algebra 1 in 'pure mathematics' courses, but Calculus 1 over here is more advanced that Calculus 1 in the States usually. That being said: the US engineering curricula are *far more* mathematically demanding in general. Like I said, Calc1-EU would be more demanding than Calc1-US, but a lot of US students even need to take a Calc3 course in the US, which is far more advanced than what most engineering students get here. So, what does the first year look like? Like I said, *a little bit* of basic mathematics and from day one you follow the courses related to your field. My university is known to deliver chemical engineers who are extremely competent in chemistry (as we are one of the very few universities who offer both a ChemEng and Chem curriculum). So my first year I'd have courses like Organic Chemistry 1, Physical Chemistry 1, Spectroscopy, Separation Processes, Single Phase Reactors.|||What are your chances of being able to get your current job or something similar back?

Maybe, the UK, Belgium, the Netherlands or Germany where practically all people speak English and where there is a very 'American-like' culture compared to Eastern Europe and there are a lot of Eastern European communities in western europe as well (and enough orthodox churches if that's a concern). I'm getting the feeling he doesn't like Eastern European culture the same way you don't like American culture... You on the other hand will be very close to home and can go visit your family very easily. Also, with European laws regarding holidays, you can spend 4-5 weeks with your husband together in your home country over the summer for example as well. I live in the Netherlands, plane tickets to my family in the Balkans is 60-80 euro's two-way. I frequently go for just a weekend!|||So, I actually went through something similar. My maternal side of the family comes from the Balkans, and my mother held a Yugoslavian passport. However, after the Yugoslav wars, she never declared her citizenship or got a new passport. Ethnically, I belong the the Serbs through my mother, as such I sought a Serbian passport. However, in my case, this was an issue, because although my mother was born in current day Serbian territory, she was raised in current day Bosnian territory. My grandparents are also Serbs, but born and raised on current Bosnian territory and got Bosnian (Republika Srpska) nationalities after the war. What I found out was that according to Serbian law (and the embassy had to dig a long, deep way down immigration law to find this) I could not claim Serbian citizenship through ius sanguinis, as, although my mother had a right to claim Serbian nationality, she didn't and as such, the 'blood line' was continued through my grandfathers birthplace, which was Bosnian. *However*, Serbia has an additional law that states that they allow claims to citizenship if one can proof that they below to the Serbian ethnic group. Which I can, as I could show that my maternal line consisted of multiple generations of Serbs and I was baptized in the Serbian orthodox church. I handed in my mothers birth certificate showing the nams of my grandparents and an official baptism certificate from my church (which I don't even attend anymore) and that was enough to claim citizenship.At that point I figured it was worth finding out if I could also get Bosnian nationality, because apparently, so I thought, I could claim Bosnian nationality through ius sanguinis through a proven direct line (both grandparents and mother). This would have been true in practically any country, but not in Bosnia. They confirmed the Bosnian government would also indeed consider my mother a Bosnian citizen, which in general should be enough to claim ius sanguinis. However, if you are born abroad to a Bosnian and a not Bosnian parent, you *also* need to be able to show you have some kind of residency in Bosnia itself to claim a Bosnian nationality. They don't allow a pure ius sanguinis claim, weirdly enough. Anyway, I hope this shows that currently the immigration/naturalisation/citizenship laws in the former Yugoslavian countries are very diverse and .. well.. rather fucked up. It also shows that you don't even have to be able to claim a direct bloodline to get citizenship (heritage laws). Anyway, I would suggest taking all the info you have to a local embassy, but be prepared to be very insistent. I think I had to mail back and forth about 20 times, asking for direct links to the laws in questions (which are of course in Serbian in my case, which luckily I was able to read), asking additional questions, refuting their assumptions and bringing my own.. etc etc. To be honest, I really think I was the first person at my country's embassy who went to claim citizenship through this route, as all the staff was hyper curious about my case when I finally visited them, yet all were also quite confused about what was and wasn't possible.The process from start to finish cost me about 2-3 years. That being said: I am very lucky to have had family in Serbia who were willing to drive cross countries multiple times to fetch me all the documents I needed on my mum from the local municipal archives and such. Also, my family already knew an official apostille approved translator, which in my (rather small) country would else have been an issue. This *greatly* shorted the process, as I was able to give the embassy all the right documents straight away.|||I mean, its not like the hoodie is neon orange and has the text LOOK AT HOW SMART I AM FOR GOING TO A VIENNA UNI on it.What do you think when you see somebody with a random logo on it?

So, if you are TYPE_MENTION, you'll have no issue answering this question: What are your goals and how are you achieving them right now?|||For me (TYPE_MENTION female) the question of giving space vs. forcing interaction is really difficult.. When I'm stressed, emotional, or anything I will silently redraw and claim my space, and that's what I need to gather myself and my mind and get through it.. But sometimes, *sometimes*, the space magnifies my stress and I get stuck in a downwards spiral. I have an SO who somehow, I don't know how, notices this and starts forcing interaction. I would push him away, he'd keep pushing back, and I'd break, cry, get angry and recover from all the stress and emotions within a couple of hours, ready to get back to my happy, productive life. But here is the point.. your ex didn't 'just randomly withdraw' because of issues and emotions. He made a conscious decision to split up with you and to be left alone. If this guy is a stereotypical TYPE_MENTION he will have made up his mind and will do anything he can to continue with his life without you. If he is a stereotypical TYPE_MENTION, he might very well not want to get back with you, even if he still loves you, because a decision was made and he's going to stick with that decision. But then again, emotions are difficult and unpredictable... so who knows how he specifically will react.I'd say: do tell him, but expect the worst, and if you indeed love him, do it after Saint Patricks day so it won't ruin both your days if indeed the worst happens.|||It really dependa on local job markets as well.

If you have a job and know the people well, go ask the financial/HR department about it. You'll be stunned how expensive you are to your employer.|||I don't get it either.. I have quite a few high functioning autistic friends and they're the easiest to deal with. Highly functioning autists are awesome in the sense that they aren't socially manipulative and you can be simply honest with them.Whenever they are doing something socially bothersome, not shutting up about a certain topic while the whole group is really fed up with it but too polite to tell the person for example, I just tell them 'I think it's time for another topic'.Same with if an autistic guyfriend overhears me talk to some girlfriends about hanging out and he asks to join, I just can tell the guy friend 'Another time, we would like to meet as girls among eachother'. None of them ever mind, because they simply didn't get the social cues and are happy to have someone just tell them, especially if they know I care about them and never mean it maliciously or try to play games with them. Most of my autistic friends actually like to mingle and talk and be social to a certain extent, having someone there who's just honest helps them socialize, as random people are more willing to talk with them if they know they don't have to deal with trying to pass social cues to an autistic person. They get to talk about the stuff they're interested in and get their social fix, and before they drive away people, they have friends who just honestly tells them when it's been enough or when they're doing or saying something awkward.|||Came to see if somebody pointed this out... Also a regular on this sub, and although I am child free, I often get hate from a minority (!) of people on this sub who take offense the moment I make a nuanced comment about how some kids can be good and kind, and how some parents do not loose themselves in parenthood but combine being a good parent with having their own individual life, or how I can understand that people like and enjoy parenthood even if it's not for me. There is a *very* vocal child hating minority on this sub who I *would* call toxic.|||This post and all the comments make me happy. :)I am even technically obese (BMI just shy from 30, 5'5'' and 180? I live in a metric world, not sure) but my weight distribution is superb. Despite being heavy, my waist to hip is 0.7 and I still fit a US 10 or 12. It does eat away at your confidence at times though, and I have trouble comparing my body type to other women who I know are considered 'pretty'. I'm not a stick figure, so I don't feel a pretty based on that category, and society tells me fat people are ugly, but I don't think I look fat either so despite my weight, so I don't fit there either. This post shows me there are more women like me and they look pretty kickass.|||I thought  I read you have a girlfriend, right? What does she think about all of this? Especially with regard to the future as in, having kids, owning a house, retirement etc.|||What's even more amazing is that they predicted *two* of this year's winners. Ben Feringa who's also on that list won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry this year as well.|||Thank you!

I mean, it's so easy to find yourself in a situation where you caved and ate a pizza and several beers with some snacks. BAM. That's about 3000 kcal extra. If you are doing CICO and are taking a healthy 500 kcal daily deficit, you'll spend the WHOLE FUCKING WEEK to just to reclaim those 3000 kcal you overate in a because you had a weak moment. That week, you didn't lose any weight. Nope, you only spend all that time tracking and being conscious about your eating to simply get back to the point where you started at the beginning of the week.|||University of Groningen (Netherlands) also offers all of its STEM bachelors+masters in English.|||I agree with /u/MyHeartsMistakes just take your time and learn the game. Leveling is not the goal in Bloodborne and Dark Souls type of games, it's about overcoming adversity one step at the time. The fact that you can find run throughs of people finishing the game on level 4 without weapons says a lot...Are you new to this type of game? In stead of farming I'd sugget using the wikis, I just the fextralive wiki as it has prettt area maps as well. Read up on the areas your in, read the pages on the enemies you're facing. Make it a goal to understand enemy behaviour and to kill enemies without getting hit. Doing this while slowly progressing you'll find yourself leveling in no time as well, just by practicing.|||I'm asking where you're from because in my experience, it matters a lot in the type of beer someone loves.

The course was meant for young, highly educated students with prior exposure to learning languages. After about 7 tot 8 months my classmates were able to pass the HSK 2 exam.|||Being a *good* parent is an *incredibly* though job, probably one of the reasons why most of us don't want children.... The thing is, the comparison with 'doctors, CEO, cooks, etc' is totally not needed, because good moms are good moms and that should hold enough value and prestige in itself. Your last paragraph is what it all comes to in my opinion, because not so interestingly enough, it's usually the shitty parents who make these kind of posts.|||For fucks sake. Everything is supposed tk be about *her* isn't it! This woman does not realise a proposal is also about you, your feelings and dreams. That your whole relationship is about you two together, not about how you are fulfilling exclusively *her* wishes.|||My country actually has those laws. The only way you can be fired on the spot if you either got yourself or someone else into danger by willfully ignoring safety regulations, committing criminal conduct while on the job (stealing, fraud etc) or if you simply refuse to work. The last one is something different than not being able to work, you can only be fired for this reason if you simply refuse to show up without there being a reason. In this last case, if you get in a car accident and the employer fires you on the spot because of it, you can fight that decision and you will actually win the case. Hell, in the case of safety regulations: if you can proof the employer didn't give you proper training to uphold those regulation you'll probably win the case as well.In all other cases, if the employer wants to get rid of an employee and the employee doesn't want to be fired (mutually agreeing to terminate the contract), the employer needs to go to court to get the contract terminated. And even in this case, the employer can only terminate the contract for serious reasons (which are all legally defined), for example, if an employee is ill you legally can't fire the employee at all (even if the reason for firing isn't related to the illness, because the employee can argue that the employer simply wants to get rid of him/her because of the illness) as the employer has the duty by law to take care of their ill employees and provide them with work and social security. So what happens if the employer goes to court and the court decides the employee is in his or her right that the contract can't be legally terminated or that the firing on the spot was unlawful? The contract is still valid, but of course, the employee can't go back to work because of 'hostile work environment etc' so the court orders the employer to pay out the employee from the contract (this can add up to multiple year salaries!) and the contract is then terminated.|||Just ask him. Tell him you stumbled upon that email and you are confused and would like him to explain. Don't be accusative, just ask what's up as if it's the most neutral question to ask ('How is the weather?'). This way he won't feel attacked and feel the need to be overly defensive. Just give him a chance to explain and take it from there. You should then continue to tell him how it made you feel, and depending on the answers he's giving you, you can always ask him to stop doing this or work out any issues he might be having with your relationship.|||Let's do a quick calculation. 30k dollars = 27k euros.If I remember correctly, about the first 7k are not taxed in Germany and your other 30k will fall in the 15% bracket.That means you'll have 7k + (20k * 0.85) = 24k yearly. Which will be an income of 2k monthly, which is more a less an average income and should work out just fine.However, when talking about being able to live on an average income, we also need to discuss living an average german lifestyle. Compared to the US, people in Europe for example don't go out for dinner. Fast food is fucking expensive, think 8 euros/10 dollars for a McD menu, while cooking dinner with fresh ingredients will be not even half of that. Also, houses are tiny. Maybe your budget will allow a two bedroom outside of the city, maybe a one bedroom within the city. But if you have a realistic understanding of what 'European city life' entails, I think you'll be fine with 2k monthly.|||Many people feel this way but don't want to admit it. My advice would be not to focus too much on the though that you need to love your child to be a good parent. A good parent takes care of the child, provide them with a stable home, a good upbringing and education, that's far more important than *love* for a child. I know many people (my own mother including) who love their children to death, but simply aren't good parents. Those children are much more fucked up than the children of parent who may not have parent who love them to death but do simply have good parents. If you get over the 'I need and am supposed to love my child' idea I think it will greatly improve your situation over the next few years. Every day from now on your child will grow older and more independent, more interesting to be with and more fun to care for.|||I don't remember how they're called, but I remember something like this from a kickstarter post maybe 1 or 2 months ago.

Talked about it with my SO and after a year or so I figured... meh, I'd be fine without them too.Everyone on this sub keeps saying you want kids or you don't, but that's really not true, it's a lifestyle mentality and until the moment you actually commit to having a child you haven't committed to the lifestyle yet.|||Oh yes, good info! This is the same in my country (Netherlands) and most other European countries as well. Usually it says so in your PhD contract that you are obliged to give a x % of your time to teaching students. This can be both at bachelor or master level and both teaching regular lectures of being a guide to a thesis lab student.|||This may be a long term option, but certainly not something that will help OP for probably another year. Uni transfers are a hassle in Europe, meaning OP might very well have to redo large chunks of the curriculum at another uni and eventually having to stay in uni longer, leading to maybe higher costs.

A movement like transhumanism needs all kinds of people: programmers, engineers, managers, entrepreneurs, politicians, lobbyists, lawyers and judges, even body mod artists or really just artists in general.Transhumanism will in the end encompass society as a whole, meaning that you'd be able to push for transhumanism from many different angles. Whatever you do, educate yourself and get a some basic understanding of IT and technology in general, so you are able to argue from a tech perspective, irrespective of which field you end in. This does not have to be a degree in IT or CS. Simply doing self study by being interested and curious about the topic is all you need. There are a lot of resources online, and whatever you choose to study, you'll have access to your schools libraries and scientific journal licenses as well.|||Gotta love people with a dominant COGFUNC_MENTION or COGFUNC_MENTION.

Like I said: I'm super excited, it's finally all starting!|||But even if it is 30k .. the average cost of a child per year is about 15k. If you truly wanted a child, that's *only* 2 years of the cost it would be to actually have it. And if you wouldn't be able to safe that amount each year for the kid, than apparently your family is not in the financial position to have a kid in the first place. Considering having children is the change of a lifetime, having to wait an additional 2 years (plus maybe an extra year for the adoption itself) shouldn't be that big of a sacrifice to make, especially as you'd be 'sacrificing' your whole life to raise this child and take care of this child to begin with.|||As someone who is learning Mandarin the comment 'you say what you write' makes no sense at all.

However, they all got in based on their HAVO (!) diplomas. The kicker: they all were top of the class. The undergraduate level is not very high in general.

Now you are coming to him saying that you also want to do something in life that will make you happy as well, and he is like, nope, that's stupid, why would you do that?

I also needed jaw surgery some months ago. I *really* understand your physical pain in this regard. I'm currently recovering from everything, some days are good, some days are hell.That's also why your post makes me sad. You really deserve more love and support. Having to get through the pain during the day is like fighting your way through the storm, knowing that  your SO will be the sunshine behind those clouds at the end of the day.I remember when I was in constant pain, my SO had times when he broke down emotionally and got sad and angry because he was giving too much and wasn't able to care for himself. At that point I'd make sure my parents or friends would come over more often so my SO had time to himself, but that was only when I had a lot of pain for weeks at the time. Surely having to care a little more and get a little less back in return for a few *days* a month isn't too much to expect from your SO.|||For the past week or so, I've been trying the intermittent fasting thingy. My main line of thinking was how much I *love* dinner, which my SO and I *always* make ourselves which loads of nice veggies, and how I *love* the feeling of just eating the nice food we made until I feel full. Not just nor hungry anymore, but simply full. This means second servings and a bunch of extra kcal. Something had to give, so I figured, I should eat as little as possible during the day to save my kcal for the evenings.So, that's what I've been doing. At first I though I would go through hell and feel damn hungry all the time, but it turns out I'm actually coping extremely well consistently over the past week or so. I simply don't eat until hungry, once I feel hungry, I drink half a litre of water and if I'm still hungry I eat something very small, like a low calorie cracker (&lt; 30 kcal) with a serving some low calorie jelly (&lt; 30 kcal) or a small apple (60-90 kcal). This week, I have consistently been able to keep my 'day eating' below 200 kcal, which leaves a whole 1000 kcal for dinner, only to feel hungry again around dinner time. Considering we cook using a lot of veggies and little meat (often non at all) this leaves a huge volume of food for me to enjoy in the evening and usually room to spare for healthy snacks (cucumbers, carrots, pickles, crackers etc). The best thing is don't feel hungry in the mornings, because I ate so much in the afternoon, which reinforced the intermittent cycle.Although I'm quite convinced I'm getting all the nutrients I need due to having properly home cooked healthy meals, I am going to monitor my day to day weight loss more carefully, as especially the last 2-3 days I've lost about 0.3 kg a day. If that's a real trend, it's a bit concerning, as 2 kg a week is way too much. Maybe there will be room for proper desserts in my diet in that case!|||My Chinese teacher explained s/sh/x as similar sound but with your tongue at different positions.s is the sharpest with the tip of your tongue against the top of your lower teeth and your mouth smiling. It's a sharp sound like a snake.sh is a softer sound compared to s, and your tongue is pressed against the top of your mouth.x is also soft and sounds like sh, but your tongue is again against your lower teeth. For me, my tongue with x is more towards the bottom of my lower teeth while s is the top of my lower teeth.|||Them being from either North or South Holland would explain a lot, because they usually care less.

Mine's from Dangerous Things, I think they also sell RFID chips. It's a small capsule which you can inject into your hand next to your thumb. I found a piercer/body mod artist who had some of these in stock and would inject them. It was mostly painless. I got my earlobes pierced at the same time (just regular piercings), which hurt way more than injecting the chip. Although you can inject them yourself, I would highly recommend finding someone with experience to place them, as they'll ensure the chip will be placed properly and the procedure will be done in a sanitary and where necessary sterile setting.|||I know, just saying though in case you were indeed considering the option of doing a PhD like you said.|||Once you know where you'll be going,  see if your prof has any contact in your field at some nearby unis.

So instead of running to the bathroom as you described in your post, you don't and simply let it go.|||I wouldn't necessarily say power hungry. TYPE_MENTION in general have a very, very strong hatred against inefficiency to the point where we go crazy if the inefficiency isn't addressed, meaning that in most cases, TYPE_MENTION will step in, take charge and do the job themselves when they think they could do a better job than the people currently taking charge do. I can't really explain it, but when I'm dropped in a situation with a high degree of inefficiency and lack of vision I just have this voice in my head that's screaming out in frustration and wants me to pull my hair out. So I step in. Not because I get off on the power leadership gets me, but because I simply cannot function in a disorganized mess that dares call itself a properly functioning unit. I can see how this can come across as power hungry, but I never really met an TYPE_MENTION who would want power for the sake of power, only because power serves as a tool to achieve something else.|||Are there any very senior female researchers at your faculty who are in a position of power?Whe have someone like this in my faculty and if this were me, I'd head straight to this female profs office and tell her about this.

The kind of woman who would take you under her wing to protect you from this kind of shit while making sure it doesn't happen again. Especially if your PI has tenure fire needs tk be fought with fire, if your PI isn't tenured, one little chat from a senior prof in a position of power can make sure they shit their pants and get their act straight because this means a fear of missing out on tenure (I have actually seen this happen, a prof being turned down from tenure because the female staff took action).These female professors have seen a lot of shit in their career, find one good one who will stand by your side and you might be able to complete your PhD comfortably after all.|||It sounds like your mother values her own happiness over the happiness of her son. Who's happiness do you value more?|||Someone else replied with more or less the same comment, to which I said I agreed! (Have a look if your interested.)However, I asked that person the same question I'll ask you, because I am interested in your answer: Should a transgender person be obliged to disclose that he/she is transgender without being asked about it to a potential sexual partner? I believe that indeed, you don't need to have a 'valid' reason not to want to have sex with someone, any reason is reason enough. But I do also believe, that if someone feels strongly about not wanting to have sex with transgender people (or people who have had more than 50 sexual partners, people with a mental illness, *whatever*) it also falls to them to ask for this information. What I'm saying is: I should not have to disclose my medical history to any potential sexual partner, just because that person *might* have a problem with it, but I *should* answer honestly if I am asked about it by a potential sexual partner. Whether we are talking about transgenderism or any other condition that might affect sexuality of either partner, is irrelevant in this case.|||OP and his SO really need to talk more. My own SO and I have a system figured out, which work really well *for us* and I can recommend each couple trying to find a similar setting which works for them:Each day (*each* day!) before we go to bed my SO and I go out to sit on the balcony and drink some tea and discuss our day. No music, no electronic, no nothing, just eachother. Sometimes we have nothing to say and go back inside within 5 minutes, and *sometimes* when either of us is extremely tired, we skip it all together. But when in our relationship shit *really* hit the fan, we would stay outside for 30+ minutes, every day, just talking to each other and communicating our feelings, discussing communication patterns. It was so hard, sitting there in the cold, being vulnerable and openly admitting our individual faults and mistakes to one another, but it made us so much stronger and understanding of each other. Like you said: there is a (negative, according to OP's SO) pattern going on and indeed, 'low emotional EQ' is in **no way** an excuse. The only way to solve it however is constructive, open and regular communication between the two of them.|||I love this game because of this exact reason: I did the exact opposite.

As it's about 70 kcal more for every half an hour you'd burn walking opposed to sitting down. On a 1200 kcal budget, that's already 6% of your budget. It's actually that significant that I figured I should walk to my workplace (20-25 min walk) instead of biking (5 minute bike ride), just to get in the extra burned calories. Walking instead of biking will net me an additional 500 calories in exercise or so every week, if we also walk another 20-25 minutes every evening, that's 900 kcal every week total. I'd call that pretty significant.I have more than enough time left in my day where I randomly sit down and do nothing, wasting my time on this earth watching tv or whatever, that I could easily fit in the time for some more walking.|||Ok, this is going to be so random, but here it goes: I was stalking /u/ghostsco 's history to go through all the bullet journal images, as she does amazing layouts (pretty please start posting more, Kira!!) and came across your post and your site.

They use that skill to adjust their tone of voice, body language and how to approach discussion topics to whoever they are talking to, depending on what they need from those people.

I was raised trilingual and the government of my home country has mandatory language education at high school, so I learned another two languages from ages 12 to 18, of which I'm now fluent in one and proficient in the other. Because of my backgound, learning language comes easier to me than most others I think, for which I'm grateful. Now I'm at uni and my uni has a very decent language centre with cheap language courses. I make learning languages a priority by enrolling for at least one course every semester so I'm never without formal language education. Currently doing Mandarin and will probably start doing Spanish soon as well.Anyway, I'm Dutch. The Netherlands is home to a bunch of multinationals who offer incredible expat packages and are very keen on hiring new engineers because of shortages. I'm especially lucky because I'm female and all those companies have diversity policies to attract more female talent.. and in my country, there are only very few female engineering students.

I'm Dutch and anyone who went to school knows the basics, anyone who actually enjoyed higher education will speak English at *at least* B2 level, but more often at C1 or C2. It's not really cool if everybody expects you to be able to speak English.The faculty I study at offers all its bachelor and masters degrees in English, meaning English is the dominant language. You can often find two native Dutch speakers talking English as if it's nothing at all to speak a foreign language, because that's the language used in that context.

Things I consider to be fun: music concerts, theater shows, visiting theme parks and zoos, going to the movies, building a pillow fort in the living room etc. etc. The real question is - in my opinion - if you are someone like me for whom 'fun' is mostly 'unproductive' and therefor 'unsatisfying' (but enjoyable nonetheless!): how *much* fun do you incorporate in your life at the expense of productivity? What's the right balance?|||Oooooooh. Ha. Thanks. Definitely learning more and more every day.|||Ok, seems I'm not the total dip shit I thought I might have been. I've actually been doing most of this already! I'll just ask some more, considering how thoughtful you are in your reply: one of my main insecurities when wearing make up is because I can't really evaluate how 'visible' my foundation is supposed to be. I have KP, so I have *a lot* of redness in my face, meaning I actually need proper foundation to cover up the redness, as a simple BB cream doesn't cut it. When I look up close(r), I can definitely see the foundation laying on top of my skin. I'm overly worried that it's 'too' much and super obvious to everyone around me, making me look like a clown. I'm in STEM as well, so I'm surrounded with a lot of men and very, very few women who actually wear make up. It's not like I can actually discuss this topic with my peers or check up their make up from up close.|||I think even among Europeans there are a lot of cultural differences. For example, in the Netherlands, it really wouldn't be frowned upon that much for lower and middle class women to become SAHMs. It's also incredibly common to work part time (2, maybe 3 days a week) once you have children, to the point society thinks you're a bad mother for *not* working part time and taking care of the kids. Among university educated women it's different I think, at least when it comes to quitting work all together. There is a strong sense of 'wasting your education' if you do. But even for highly educated women, working part time is pretty much the societal norm.I often joke how in most of Europe, feminism was about women's rights to gain access to equal labour laws and earn their own money. In the Netherlands, feminism was about women getting governmental assurances (in the form of various subsidies) to make them less dependent on men in the case of divorce and still be able to stay SAHMs.|||Not sure about Wales, but in my EU country this doesn't happen. There are only two ways to get into an ER, either inside an ambulance, or through a referral by your primary care physician who will announce your visit to the hospital ahead of time. If you 'just show up' your insurance will not cover you, and you have to pay for the whole thing out of pocket, which is *a lot* of money, while with a referral, it's free. The mum is totally right to go to the GP first, as 'going to the ER' is not something you just do in socialized health care systems.|||If you want a 'real' college town, Groningen would be a good choice. About 20% of all inhabitants are students. Amsterdam is cool, obviously, but very much a metropolitan city, not a college town. Housing is an issue *everywhere* in the Netherlands (and not just for students), but if you fall for the media shit storm about housing being difficult in Groningen and took that as a reason to go to *Amsterdam* instead, you'd be a fool. A few major student housing development projects are being finalized in the next 2-3 years in Groningen, so the major shortage of last year will - hopefully - just have been an unfortunate incident. Also, the Faculty of Economics and Business where you'd be studying in Groningen is pretty well accredited. They are both EQUIS and AACSB accredited. Currently, the university doesn't offer MBA (long enough) to also be AMBA accredited and place them in a global top 100 of business schools, but with EQUIS and AACSB alone they already are top 1%.  |||Dear OP, your post was removed as per rule number 2: cover pages are not allowed on r/bujo. |||I guess it does sound cringey, but you know, at least for me what I described above is the *actual* thought process. Think, decide, plan, just do it. It's just so easy and natural to just do it, to the point that questions like 'how?' just sound absolutely ridiculous, because the answer is still 'just **do** it!*.You asked the question, you got the answer. Maybe not the answer you want, but the answer that's the truth. If you don't like it, sorry, there is no magic formula, it's just hard work, discipline, and putting mind over matter, while not making excuses for yourself.|||Hmm.. interesting. Honest question: Why did you feel the need to remove your previous comment in which you said \\\"you just keep playing the victim honey\\\"?|||The first step is easy:Go to your GP and ask them to run a blood test for all major deficiency categories. If you notice you get tired throughout the day on a regular basis, there is a big chance you're deficient in something. Your solution could be as easy as taking a daily vitamin D supplement (which was the case for me for example) which will help you *a lot* more than any type of ginseng or whatever will help you. Repeat every couple of years. |||There is one major problem with this list: it's not that difficult to learn any of the languages mentioned to a A1/A2 level, simply because A1/A2 *is actually a really low proficiency level*. But that's also the problem, because there is no way you can actually actively *keep* your proficiency at A1/A2 level. Either you spend some more time with the language, internalize it, and you continue  on to slowing reaching a lower B1 level, or you just forget the stuff because you effectively only memorized a set of basic sentences. Especially if you want to learn 10+ languages at an A1/A2. Even if you did manage to remember all those basic sentences, I would not consider that 'knowing a language'. |||I know, that's why I'm checking whether I'm right about being able to connect the M.2 to my SO's motherboard using the adapter to get the M.2 on a regular PCIe slot.|||Biking really is a very common mode of transport where I am and the infrastructure is solid across the country. Long distance scenic bike routes are very popular and many people consider long bike rides as leisure activities. Fifty miles would take about 5 hours at a leisurely pace, which is very much doable (unless your BOB contains 20 crowbars, several pounds worth of gold coins, and 1000 rounds of ammo and ends up weighing 100 pounds).|||Yeah. I decided to look up omani citizenship laws... As a child free woman. Nope. Not ever going to happen.As a woman, even if you married an omani, you need to apparently Haven 'given' your omani husband a SON to be able to get citizenship. Oh well, I have access to pretty much all non Muslim countries with my Dutch + Serbian status. Guess I should count my blessings.|||Bullies prey on the weak, or at least, those that are perceived as weak. Calling them out once in their face usually helps a lot. Depending on how they exactly bully you a comment like 'You are behaving very unprofessionally right now, you should reconsider how you treat colleagues, because I will not stand for this behaviour' or a similar comment may help.|||Not OP, but commented earlier because I got Serbian citizenship later in life as well (with my family on mothers side being Serbian).I noticed how every time this pops up, there are *always* a couple of Serbs who honestly don't understand why you would even want Serbian citizenship if you have a 'nicer' one already (in my case, an EU passport). Honestly, it makes me quite sad, so I'll comment here as well to offer another point of view and maybe open up a discussion.I mean, I do get it, I guess. When I look at my cousins who are in Serbia, it's hard to see how they are pretty much trapped with far less opportunity than I have, simply because of their nationality. I do sense quite a bit of resentment, not for their ethnicity but their situation. I guess the passport is somewhat of an embodiment of those feelings, so it seems strange to have that be something another person wants to have.But for me: I grew up in my home country that I very much call home and I very much relate to the culture if my home country. On the other hand, I grew up learning Serbian, celebrating our and our family friends' slava, celebrating both western and orthodox christmas, going to an orthodox church. Even though it's not the dominant culture I grew up in, it has been a significant influence in my life. I feel having nationality solidifies that connection now I'm an adult who has far less 'natural connection' to my heritage now I'm no longer living with my family.Also, we have family, houses and land in Serbia. I can definitely see how it might be easier in the future to have citizenship when having to deal with this kind of stuff after my grandparents and parents pass away.Now in terms of the benefits of having dual citizenship in general (not the main reasons but it definitely helped convince me I wanted to get my citizenship):A passport is a very valuable thing. We don't know what is going to happen on the world stage in the next 50 years. I can definitely imagine that having both am EU and Serbian passport can be a safety net. Considering how difficult it is to go through the process, there is no way to only get it once needed, so I made sure I got it now. If you have a right to obtain such a valuable thing, why *wouldn't* you go after it just to have it in case you need it?Less dramatic and bleak reason: the EU + Serbia passport combination is pretty kickass in terms of access to visa etc. across the world. |||You know what.. I had a whole commented typed up but I'm not even going to bother.Let me just say this: the fact that your first and natural response is to evaluate how you can use information to manipulate, harm, and hurt instead of using it to empathise, learn and grow says a lot about you as a person, and it ain't a pretty picture. |||So, here's the deal. Any higher education *must* allow admission of any student that meets the required entry requirements (if there are no exceptions like a numerus fixus). The entry requirements is a HAVO diploma or equivalent. The HAVO diploma is regulated by government to ensure quality. Which means that to have your non-HAVO diploma acknowledged to be of sufficient quality, your diploma needs to be backed by an independent regulatory body that sets educational standards as well. Anyone can *say* they diploma is of a certain level, but only a regulatory body (accreditation!) can *proof* this is the case.For example, in the Netherlands we have some kind of 'semi' home school system. It's home school, but through online/distance learning by an *accredited* school, and the diplomas are given out by that school. If you were truly home schooled - so no affiliation to an accredited school whatsoever - from a Dutch perspective, you simply *don't* have a diploma but just a piece of paper that says you have a certain level of education which in no way can be checked or corroborated. Any chance you have a GED and a couple of A-levels through a local community college (with official transcripts of those A-levels provided by the CC)? Something like that might go a long way in proving you meet the entry requirements. If you don't have *any* of that, and only - again from a Dutch legal perspective - only the word of your parents that they did a good job educating you... I don't know what to tell you.. I sincerely doubt you'd have any recourse - both in NL as well as most of the European Union as diploma valuation across the EU are unified. In that case you'd might consider discussing with your school whether you could take a year of CC in the US and see whether they'd accept that to grant you entry instead. |||The article is total garbage, I agree, however, I do feel at times this sub goes to the extreme of being in support of CICO. I often come across posts in which the comments leave a bad aftertaste because people are like 'go do CICO or you'll never loose the weight, CICO is the only way forward'. Well, CICO is not a good method for me. I did CICO, but having a hyper competitive personality, doing CICO made me focus far, far too much on my food and put me in 'competition mode', resulting in me simply eating *too little* because less calories, means more weight loss, means I was succeeding. My focus on food made me focus less on more important parts of my life: my family, my job, my studies.When I quit CICO, I started indeed focussing on 'how I feel' like the person from the article is suggesting. Questioning myself: 'Am I hungry?', 'What kind of hunger?', 'What would be the healthiest food option for this kind of hunger?'.  Anyway, this made eating properly a much healthier exercise, and it's actually teaching me some proper habits in terms of understanding my body and its nutritional needs. These are things I was definitely not learning when doing CICO.Again, I'm sure CICO is holy grail for many people, and there are many people who did not experience the negative effects of CICO like I did, however, I think it's good to agree that CICO is not a holy grail for *everyone*.|||Super! Om de een of andere manier ben ik hier heel enthousiast over. Ben al een tijdje op zoek naar een leuke data set om m'n excel skills op los te laten en mee te oefenen.  Anyway, ik zal t.z.t. je wel een update sturen als ik de tijd heb gehad hiermee aan de slag te gaan. |||Yes, if you study CS or AI (or a STEM degree and you're exiting into a career as a programmer) there is plenty of job opportunities as there are major (*major*) shortages in that field. |||I was having a course on inorganic chemistry, and during a tutorial we were discussion orbital theory. I was sitting next to a good friend of mine who is a 'true' chemist. It was awful, the only thing I could do was blankly stare into space thinking 'what on earth am I doing with my life' and which point this friend whispered into my ear, with full enthusiasm 'isnt this amazing? Orbital theory is absolutely beautiful don't you agree?'. In that split second, I figured chemistry was not for me, and I switched programmes soon after.|||Quite easy actually. Practically all rankings are very heavily research oriented. Stuff like number of publications in top journals, number of Nobel prize winners etc. count heavily. UoAS traditionally do very little independent research because they are educational institutions, not necessarily research institutions (although they started to do more and more niche level research, but because it's niche, it doesn't carry you far in the ranking anyway...)|||Top, dank voor je antwoord. Wat betreft WW2: vandaar ook mijn opmerking om pas vanaf ~1950 te simuleren juist om die monumentale post-war groei eruit te filteren. Hier zit ik dus mee. Wat is voor jou een *realistische* worst case scenario? Ik heb familieleden uit niet-Westerse landen die oorlog hebben meegemaakt. Zij hadden *veel geld* (land, boerderijen etc). Toen de oorlog kwam, was er nog maar een prioriteit: het land uit weten te komen en settlen in een veiliger gebied. Al hun geld is daaraan opgegaan. Het feit dat ze geld hadden was een enorme reden *waarom* ze het land uit konden. Dit soort worst cases veranderen niks aan het *belang* van capitaalopbouw, maar zijn - naar mijn mening - ook totaal niet relevant voor je risicoanalyse als je plan is om van een rustige 'jonge' oude dag te genieten. Dit soort dramatische worst cases gaan je namelijk niks zeggen over je savings rate. Mocht zo'n dramatische worst case voorkomen, dan is early retirement waarvoor je nu aan het plannen ben gewoon ronduit niet meer een optie. Waarom zou je dit dan wel meenemen in je analyse voor je savings rate?Veel nuttiger in dat geval is naar 'realistische' worst case scenarios te kijken: een niet-desastreuze crash, oliecrisis, oorlogen in gebieden die jou niet raken maar wel impact hebben op de markt, dot com bubbles, etc. Dat zijn namelijk het type 'worst case' scenarios waarbij je nog wel 'normaal' met pensioen kunt gaan, maar waarbij je erg afhankelijk bent van de markt of je portfolio voldoende gaat zijn. |||In general, when you take on the nationality of a new country, you must relinquish your old. In the case of your GF, that might be an issue, as if Brexit goes through, she might loose her EU Freedom of Movement right if she relinquishes her Lithuanian citizenship in favour of a UK citizenship. I'd suggest waiting until Brexit clears up, so she knows what choice she's actually making, because I'm guessing there is no age limit on her naturalizing as a UK citizen.I googled, and found this: http://www.migration.lt/en/migration-services/lithuanian-citizenshipIt states that those who acquire a second citizenship **under the age of 21** are not required to relinquish their Lithuanian citizenship, and can keep both. I'm not sure what's the case on the UK side of things, but depending on how old your GF is, this is a very interesting option. |||I had an epiphany when I was googling tailors and saw how one of the sites the tailor promoted himself as the tailor of choice for a local higher end store I own some items from. What I did: I made several phone call to the various stores I like and own stuff from (stuff that's expensive enough to make me nervous about tailors fucking up the item, as it has happened before) and asked them which place they send their clothes to for alterations. I made a list of all tailors they mentioned and picked one of those after googling some more etc.|||This skirt is so gorgeous. You should definitely find a way to wear this more casually, more often! Anyway, it looks a bit velvety from the picture. My advice would be, if you want to wear a skirt this 'extreme' and luxurious casually, you need to balance it with something more simple on top, both in terms of texture as well as prints etc. A simply wool/cotton mix shirt. I think I actually wouldn't pair it with white, as it would get a very female version smokey kind of feel out of it. Thinking of items from my own wardrobe, two shirts come to mind which I would probably pair the skirt with:https://topvintage.nl/nl/vintage-retro/50s-dune-jumper-in-burgundy?https://topvintage.nl/nl/vintage-retro/40s-picot-roundneck-top-in-ruby-red?Both are 50s inspired shirts, so they sit on the waist instead of the hip. Which you definitely need to show of this high waist skirt in its full glory. I would definitely wear an outfit like this just on a regular daily basis. Own it. It's beautiful and maybe a bit out there, but *not* over the top.|||This is me as well. I think choosing to take on your SO's name is a very personal decision. I feel a very strong connection between my name and personal identity, which to me is a very deep and profound feeling. However, I know that there are women who *for exactly the same reason* choose to take on their husbands name, which is just as valid a choice. If you have a strong believe regarding your name (either pro or against changing it), I believe this is important enough to choose based on your believes, and simply deal with any practicalities (such as your publication list) when they come up. Practicalities will never weigh up against these core feelings of personal identity. |||Dutch/Serbian here, raised in the Netherlands..  I'm so glad I found this comment. You are spot on. It frustrates me a lot how many western Europeans do *honestly* not recognize the privilege they are born in. Even if you are lower class in western Europe with a comparatively low income, you're still incredibly lucky. I think the OP should not necessarily try to understand 'Slavic culture' but in general become more aware of the extreme wealth disparity among nations. I honestly don't think OP understand what it is like to be born, raised and spending your life in countries like Serbia or Albania. Obviously, there are worse places to live, but still.. |||I have started wearing more bold colours and I found a seriously good trick for this: pick maybe 3 base colours that go together and several shades in each of those colours. If you buy mostly clothes within this set of colours, everything will fit together really amazingly and you can just mix and match all the colours to your hearts content and be bold while still looking really polished. Be careful about buying items that are outside of those swatches and carefully consider how well this item will fit in with your existing colours. Try not to buy items simply because you love the colour, but would only work with one specific trouser or skirt because it clashes with most of the stuff you own. I don't know about you ladies, but I really do not have the budget or space to buy items which can only be worn under very specific circumstances or in specific combinations. If the one-off item doesn't go with the bulk of your colours, guaranteed you wouldn't wear it enough to justify buying it. And if you would wear it all the time because you love it *that* much, that colour should be one of your main wardrobe colours anyway. |||It's not only uncommon, it's downright illegal unless under some very specific circumstances (children of a traveling circus employees who are constantly on the move come to mind, or extreme mental/physical impairment which even special needs schools can't accommodate). The parents need governmental permission to be exempted from the law.We're talking about a couple of *hundred* children being home schooled in the Netherlands nationwide at any given time.|||This sounds about right. 2x regular appointments (one to check, one to extract) at 20-25 euros. A set of xrays at about 50ish euros. And an extraction plus tools at maybe 80ish euros (multiples done in one sitting is cheaper).Here's the thing OP: dentistry pricing is set by the government. Like in the US, there is medical coding, but the coding scheme and pricing attached to each code is set up front by the government. This means you'll never be too surprised about costs, and all dentistry offices will charge exactly the same for a procedure, and you could always ask your dentist during your first visit about cost estimations.If your dentist can't extract them and you'll need a surgical intervention from a dental surgeon, this IS covered by your health insurance (provided you get the referral from your dentist first before you make an appointment at the hospital, can't just show up at the hospital like in the US!). In that case you'll be out your 'own risk' which typically is 350-400 euros, unless you took on an additional own risk amount to lower your monthly premium in your plan. Everything above that amount is covered.|||They only sell rooms and studios to bachelor/master students, apartments are reserved for phd students. Don't think this will help you a lot if you want an apartment to be honest. Just mentioned it to show the constant 'housing market' fear mongering is not necessarily fair or true for more 'regular' incoming students looking for a room.|||Wow... this is horrible. As much as it goes against your personal experience: we do exist. My guy being open and in touch with his emotions was one of the key reasons why I fell in love with him (and he is one big, muscular 'manly man' as well, which I find insanely attractive). We have cried on each others shoulder a lot.    For fucks sake, I've been together with my guy for over six years and he cried on my shoulder *yesterday* because he's going through shit that makes him feel lonely and isolated at the moment. Getting his emotions out helped him, and I was very much happy to be there for him and provide him a save place to get those emotions out. My girlfriends and their men are very much the same.|||I agree wholeheartedly with Amarillys. I wanted to comment on something else though, because what your are going through in terms of thoughts and emotions is something really profound. You are now going through your phase of puberty in which you are mentally transitioning from child to adult. You're no longer looking at things and situations from a pure child's point of view, but like you noticed, your getting a whole bunch of new and additional thoughts and feelings associated with adult mental capacities. What's tough right now is that you have to deal with this new mental state, while only having the experience of a child to fall back on. This doesn't match, and is one of the reasons why puberty is so hard.If you have a good relationship with your parents (or adult siblings, aunts, uncles, etc or even trusted teachers), I would really recommend you to *do* discuss this situation, but from a perspective of 'this is how it makes me feel, and I'm having trouble coping' instead of 'what should I do to help'.Untill you build some more experience yourself, talking this through with trusted adults will allow you to lift along their life experiences a little bit, and will make it easier to make sense of all these new thoughts and feelings.|||I'm an engineer who did both a business and engineering bachelor, and is now doing  two masters in both. As much as I can absolutely recommended this combination, especially when it comes to large scale engineering management, I probably wouldn't recommend it in your case. You will NOT learn how to be an entrepreneur during a business degree. That's not what's it's about, and you'll be thoroughly disappointed if that's your expectation. If you are in it for becoming an entrepreneur you will be much better off putting your time in visiting venture labs, start up weekends etc and simply learn as you go from others who are further along compared to you. In business as a degree you might deal with topics like product innovation, but that would be in the context of 'what about organizational design will facilitate innovation initiatives' and *not* how to actually come up with ideas and how to act on them yourself. Like I said, what is being taught during a business degree can be serious benefit to an engineer in a business setting, but not necessarily for an entrepreneur.|||Honestly, this video scared me. She kept calling this woman a 'beginner', and although I get that you'd want someone with a high level of fitness and skill to show off proper form etc... the only thing I could think was 'If *she* is a beginner, what on earth am I doing even trying this'. It was nice how they clearly showed how form changed over the course of getting stronger and more capable at pilates. That was a big plus.That being said, I don't know... it left a bad taste in my mouth with how Romana handled this and actually made me feel like pilates is something that's exclusively meant for people who are already upper level fit, opposed to it being useful to anyone.|||I'll try to give two examples which may not be the most accurate, but will hopefully show what I mean. I'll be comparing Elon Musk and Frank Underwood (from House of Cards).Musk has a vision: colonizing Mars. This his his Ni vision for what humanity should strive for. Except.. It's currently a really far fetched plan. So Musk went to work and came to the conclusion: I need to make electric cars! He never started Tesla to build a successful car company.. He simply realized he needed specific battery technologies for his Mars vision to become reality, and after analysing what was before him through his Te, building an electric car company was the best way to achieve that goal. This is what I would say is forcing reality into a vision (Ni Te). Now, take Underwood. He didn't have a *vision*, he simply had a goal: to become God damn president and become powerful. Why? Because he truly believed he could do a better job than anyone else, because everyone else did a shit job (Te). He never had a vision or dream for America, he just wanted to be the person to get the job done. The whole series is about Underwood reading the political board game (Te) and using his Ni to anticipate and plot. But whenever he had a lightbulb moment, it was because he heard or spotted the slightest thing, which made his Ni do: that's what going to happen and that's what I'm going to do about it. This is what I would call shaping reality to what you belief it can be (Te Ni). ENTJs are like Frank. Maybe not as morally misguided, but their intuition is *reactive* to what they see, hear, or otherwise sense. It's analysis of the outside world first which results in goals, and intuition telling us the best way to achieve those goals. INTJs are different, they use their analytical ability to assess reality and find the best way to achieve their intuitive goals. The method an INTJ chosen to use might not be the most direct, effective, logical pathways at first glance (take Tesla for example)... But it starts making sense when you consider that the *timespan* for which INTJs plan for is *way* longer than ENTJs do. While Musk is totally content building whole companies as part of a 30-40+ year plan he has in mind, an ENTJ would say that's madness, simply because you can't effectively oversee whether your approach will actually be successful over such a long time frame, as Te simply doesn't reach that far into the future.|||Just saying, but this has a serious cultural component to it as well. I am northern European, and all I could think of when reading your Se quote is: oh look, another insincere and fake stereotypical American. (Regardless of whether you are American or not.)That's definitely not the thing you want to go for when establishing rapport. If any americans are wondering why it sounds fake: in northern European cultures you don't go about asking everybody you meet how they are doing. If you do so, you better be prepared to hear an honest answer as the question actually serves a purpose. Your close colleague might very well answer 'im doing shit right now because my wife served me with divorce papers this weekend' and you ahould be willing to deal with that and offer support because you asked a question which implied willingness to actually hear the answer, or your meeting partners will tell you they had a busy and stressful day, implying that they would appreciate it if the meeting can go as quick and smoothly as possible without unnecessary bullshit. The typical American 'how are you' is in that sense not a sincere how are you, which will make you look fake and that shit is not appreciated in this cultural setting. |||The system really reinforced getting primary care as well. You pay a monthly insurance fee, but if you need care, you have to cover the first ~400 euros yourself over all the medical costs you incur over the course of a year, before your insurance kicks in and pays for the outstanding balance. We call this your 'individual risk' contribution. However, primary care is not included in this 'individual risk' contribution, meaning that (outside of your monthly insurance fee of course), seeing your GP or GP assistant is totally free of charge. There also is a system where each region of the country is connected to a centralized GP out of office hours outpost. Meaning that if you need medical care in the middle of the night or in the weekends, you can call the outpost, book an appointment with the on duty GP and go to the outpost instead of the ER, again, free of charge as it is primary care. The outpost GP may then refer you to an ER, just like your own GP would. |||Dresses look really good on you! You should try to find another dress in a similar colour to that of the jacket, as the colour really suits you. Should look kick ass on you! Maybe check out 50s inspired A-line dresses. It's a really pretty silhouette which I think would like nice on you, and those dresses are super versatile, as you can easily wear those going out, to work, for weddings, or just casually. |||What makes other types so inefficient? I mean, it's really not that difficult. You set a goal, decide what needs to be done to get there, plan your actions, and *just do it*.No whining, no bitching, no endless 'but I can't because ... '. Just fucking do it already. |||So ask yourself; 1. Why are you doing a job you hate? What's holding *you* back to make changes to your life?2.

They open up registration in the spring already. If you are early and apply early, you'll get a room easily enough. You don't have to visit either, it's all done online. It's only if you wait until the last minute when all international housing is filled up and when also all Dutch students are looking for a room you'll have trouble as an international. |||Can I just say how amazing it is how one single non dominantly, stereotypical white movie can bring so much more diversity, different styles, bodies, faces to the red carpet? It truly lifts the bar for everyone and makes it far more interesting to look at. I hope this trend continues, and we see more not only racial diversity, but also diversity in terms of what the men and women are willing to wear on the red carpet. Away with the standard of what is appropriate for red carpet attire in terms of what we grew accustomed to, and bring on many new, inspiring, unconventional outfits instead.|||I personally wouldn't be interested in starting a cricket association, but if you are and willing to put in the effort, shoot me a message, because I'm more than happy to help you figure out the legal and social mine field of Groningen associations. I'm definitely willing to help you get in touch with the right people through my own network, simply because the idea of a cricket association is pretty awesome.|||Navy/burgundy (and camel) were actually my starting point for my set of  colours! That's where the shades came in for me. If you want to spice it up, I really recommend looking for blue/red shades that are less common but work well with your complexion and navy/burgundy clothes. My trick is to take your base colours (navy, burgundy, camel in my case) and have both a set of warmer and colder shades that work for you. I like to keep the number of colours limited, unlike the album of OP, but spice it up by using different tones of those shades (combining warm and cold colours can be visually super interesting). In OPs album, most of the outfits use contrasting colours, but they work because the 'hue' or 'colour intensity' (I don't know the proper English word for it) are the same to create balance. As for some examples of shades to compliment my navy/burgundy base, I really like teal and certain shades of blush pinks. A color like coral would work really nicely as well (even though I personally dislike coral). My third colour is camel supplemented with shades such as burnt orange and peach. *All* of these work together if you play it well. I'd even be able to combine the pastel peach + blush together to have a very light, summer-y, colourful outfit, without sacrificing the overall integrity of my wardrobe. Quick edit: I should mention that I have a perfectly neutral skin tone.. I can imagine finding both warm and cold colours that fit your complexion will be more difficult of your skin tone is obvious warm or cold. |||This is a very good point. I'm going to check out where all the train tracks in my city are exactly. You bring up another point: I live really near my university's science complex, which includes rather expansive chemical labs. I'm a chemical engineer and my SO is a chemist, we both spend most of our days in those buildings. I *know* the kind of shit that's contained in those buildings and you don't need a train load of that stuff to have serious health hazards right around the corner of my home.Some kind of chemical spill (doesn't even have to be airborne either) is definitely a risk factor in my life.|||Yeah, the class as a whole needs to continue and can't wait for the student who doesn't put in the time and effort to keep up with the pace. This can definitely give a false sense of security in terms of assumed language proficiency. Seems you didn't though! You learned a skill for life by keeping up with everything and that's a major accomplishment. This is the good side of actually doing classes instead of being fully self taught (although this sub tends to disagree). If you put in the effort, the classes will have made sure you know what you're doing through and through every step along the way. That's the foundation you need to never lose your language ability.|||You are right, bullet journal is not per definition a *productivity system*, but it is a productivity *tool*. Although there are many uses for a bullet journal, this sub focusses specifically on its productivity aspects, as it's very difficult to find bullet journal content related to purely productivity. There are plenty of other communities that focus on other aspects (e.g. r/basicbulletjournal for non-art content) which are widely recommended by the users of this sub! This kind of sistersub promotion is also very much accepted by the mods. The crowd that is looking for productivity content is small(er), and this space gets easily overwhelmed by other crowds which is what makes this sub valuable and also why moderation is so strict. You mention you are disappointed by the productivity focus, while from our perspective, the whole productivity focus is the singular goal of this sub. I am honestly curious what you expected to find (and clearly didn't) instead.Some history: A few months ago, this sub went through a sort of existential crisis as moderation ny previous mods was limited, resulting in this sub and r/bulletjournal becoming more or less the same. That's when the new mods took over and it was decided (*by the community*) to have this sub go back to its original purpose of supporting productivity content.The comment requirement is mainly a tool to have OP think about *why* they are posting to this sub. I have indeed seen that most of the aesthetics submissions have dwindled over the past months, so like you said, the 'don't post pretty stuff just because it's pretty\\\" has indeed been more ingrained among the subscribers.Next to cover pages, I have indeed removed other content as well in which the OP did not carefully consider this question and the discussion did not lead to bujo productivity. In my opinion, this will be the next step into returning this sub to its roots. Ideally, this sub becomes an amazing point of reference in which each post has a proper discussion on what worked and did not work for this particular user with images *supporting* the productivity discussion. In that regard, it really doesn't matter *what* you post about. This could be spreads, daily lists, a tracker, symbols used, anything really... as long as the underlying thought is: I'm posting this because I'm sharing my thoughts on how this part of my journal did or did not help in increasing my productivity. Last week we even had posts about preprinted planners (so no bujo at all) and the OPs used the comment section to discuss how they thought elements of these planners would be beneficial for bujo users as well. That's all great stuff for this sub!|||Thanks!|||Hey, I actually got my Serbian citizenship through article 23!My mum emigrated to my country of birth on a Yugoslavian passport and never got a new passport after once she got her new citizenship through marriage. She also never applied for my citizenship.I figured I could rely on citizenship by decent laws, but I couldn't because my mum never declared her nationality so my claim defaulted to my mother's father, who has a Bosnian (Serbian Republic) passport now. However, the consulate helped me to get my citizenship through Article 23, in which you have to proof you are part of the 'Serbian diaspora'. I handed in exactly two documents: my mother's birth certificate which showed that at least she was born on Serbian soil even if formally my grandparents do not have Serbian citizenship and my baptismal certificate of the Russian (!) orthodox church I was baptised at (no Serbian orthodox churches in the country at the time...). That was it. Please don't let all the people here who are sceptical about your reasons for getting a passport let you down. I get why this is important to you and those reasons are valid. It took me 3 years and 6 or 7 trips or so the the consulate to get everything arranged and walk out with my passport, but looking back, it was definitely worth it.|||Even worse: she'd have to go back *in* to get the original surgery she came for. |||Not everyone one lives in (semi-)rural areas though.. I'm urban. Very few people I know in the city own a car because there is no need. Nation wide public transport is also top notch, so even when you leave the city often, it doesn't make sense to own a car in many cases. That doesn't leave space to leave your stuff anywhere *except* your bag. |||I commented last time with my thoughts on the topic of potentially having too much mods. I'm happy to see you've discussed this within your group of mod-prospects! New idea which you can discuss: I'm a big fan of transparent moderation policies. Especially with smaller subs, it's good to be open about moderation activity, especially when issues pop up and mods start to become inactive. Another reason why I recommend it for this sub specifically is because this is a women's focused sub. Once gendered subs (like many other types of subs) get big, moderation becomes more difficult because you will find yourself policing beyond a set of strict, easy rules and instead mod based on the purpose and values of the sub. This can derail. Being transparent helps in that not happening because it opens up the discussion way before things go wrong.You and u/canyoustop should really consider using publicmodlog. This is a bot you add as a moderator to your sub (without any mod privileges) and will broadcast the modlog to a public database. That way, all mod actions (removals, mod comments, wiki changes, rule changes, etc) become public for the whole community to see. |||How would your dad feel about you going on a holiday trip with a group of your male friends who he knows are proper Muslims to a neighbouring Muslim country? Maybe as a celebration for all of you finishing your studies and heading off to university? If you're able to get to Oman/UAE, there are *a lot* of direct flights to the UK, for which you won't need a visa as you are a citizen. Bring cash, go to the airport, and book any last minute flight to the UK you can. Yeah, you'll drop your friends in the act, which will not be nice, but you'll have your freedom. One thing is sure: once you are out and back in Europe, your dad can't do jack shit to get you back. |||I had a good laugh reading your post. The way you match your jewellery is the exactly opposite from me. I like using jewellery to make the outfits look slightly out of place in a subtle way, to make things a bit more interesting. For example, when I where more delicate, vintage inspired outfits, I always combine it with modernist/brutalist style jewellery.|||Not having a degree will outright exclude you from obtaining an EU blue card, but many EU countries offer work visas based on only an income threshold. These thresholds are usually pretty high (think medior/senior level in high paying sectors).Also, I think coming over with these romanticized ideas on emigrating to Europe are the quickest way to finding yourself in a really disillusioned, burned out spot. Emigrating can be amazing, but is hard work and you'll have to deal with a lot of shit. If you are able to save the kind of money you claim, you should really come over for some proper holidays before deciding whether and to which country you want to move.|||Naast m'n andere comment op deze post wil ik dit zelf ook onderschrijven. Dit is ook een hele belangrijke reden waarom kosten wat kost thuis blijven wonen ook averechts kan werken.Ik snap dat schulden doodeng zijn op OP's leeftijd, maar het is goed om je te beseffen dat thuis blijven meer gevolgen heeft dan alleen een mogelijk lagere studieschuld: het beperkt bijvoorbeeld ontzettend je mogelijkheden wat betreft het opbouwen van een netwerk aan bedrijfscontacten via je studievereniging/universiteit/beroepsvereniging/etc. omdat je niet makkelijk naar dergelijke activiteiten kunt vanwege je reistijden. Deze tijdsrestricties maken ook dat je minder gemakkelijk andere waardevolle ervaring opdoet: commissies, bestuurswerk, studentassistentschappen.Het is allang niet meer zo (zelfs voor bètas) dat een opleiding een baangarantie oplevert. Zeker voor de betere banen is het 'totaalplaatje' waarin je hebt laten zien dat je vol voor je eigen ontwikkeling bent gegaan en je eigen pad gevonden hebt een must om zelfs maar op gesprek te mogen komen.|||You might want to crosspost to r/notebooks. I've seen posts on that sub that ask for *very* obscure features, and somehow, the sub always manages to pull recommendations out of their magic hat.|||We adopted an old cat some month ago with quite advanced liver failure. He died since, but if we ever get another old, sick kitty like him, definitely naming him Nephron.|||Snap ik! Als je er ooit aan toe komt, laat het me vooral weten. Ben erg benieuwd :)|||Yeah.. I started getting into bitcoin some weeks ago, simply seriously reading up on it, trying to understand what the upcoming fork is about, and buying a fraction of a coin simply to experience the buying and moving process of bitcoin... I was planning on spending several grand on bitcoin before this price surge starts... I think I'm going to wait till a crash in the coming months.|||I think there is a massive difference as well between having your phone on hand and having a quick look if you get a text/WhatsApp message from someone (a thing that's directed at you as an individual, from another individual), versus checking 'social media'. I would think it's pretty rude to randomly start scrolling on FB or whatever when you're one on one with someone. Also, just checking a message in itself is something different compared to starting whole conversations with another individual. To me its fine to answer a quick question from somebody, or to let them know you're unavailable right now in a situation OP describes, but don't start texting back and forth every couple of minutes..|||In my opinion, the inequality is mainly due to (stereo)typical, toxic masculinity which is especially strong in engineering due to it being a classically male dominated field, having evolved from the more physically demanding blue collar fields. It's *really* hard to sit through an engineering degree, if both your classmates and professors make underhanded sexist jokes, while *honestly* not realizing why it's not ok to do so, or not even realizing they are sexist to begin with. Anyway, I recently saw this clip about some PR campaign by Shell, but they do make a point: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpM_faC36mAThat being said, I am now a graduate student, and I seriously do see major differences between the men my own age, and those from older generations. Things are changing, and although representation (even in my generation) is lacking, younger men are in my experience more respectful and more understanding and more welcoming to women.Now, how I try to make the difference: I have worked MY ASS off to make me a seriously (and I mean *seriously*) attractive fresh graduate hire. I already have several companies pursuing me to hire me the moment I graduate. Companies nowadays are dying to hire female engineering graduates, which puts me in a very good position to demand things I find important. Whenever I send a CV to a company, I either mention in my email or letter (it's even on my personal business cards for gods sake) that I will only consider companies who have a dedicated diversity policy and are actively working towards equality. I have turned down interest in companies already who could not provide me with proof of a diversity policy, and in those cases I make sure to let the HR and management know I am turning them down specifically for that reason. Not sure if it works, but hey, we all have to contribute somehow and if all female engineers would do this, I think we can push for more institutional change.|||This... also, you you already know you want to a LLM, be sure to explicitely ask *both* the UC and the LLM degree people what their entry requirements are for admission with a UC bachelor degree.I'm 95% certain (because this is typically the case) you *can* get direct entry, *if* you take a *very* specific set of courses in your UC curriculum... which might be constrict your UC experience to a point you could have just as well done a LLB programme.Also, note that even if UC Erasmus might have a curriculum that will allow entry into LLM, this might very well *only* hold for Erasmus taught LLM programmes. There is not guarantee any other (European) LLM programme will grant you entry based on an UC programme, while the Bologna agreements made getting accepted into a European LLM if you have an accredited LLB from anywhere in Europe far more likely/easier, because there are European standard for these programmes.|||You will encounter shitty people everywhere, sadly. Glad it all turned out the way it did, seems like you actually made some friends so you're not alone anymore! One day, you'll come out of a club yourself and see a guy or a girl being harassed like you were yesterday. Pay it forward by helping another stranger, and make the world a little bit better by doing so. Good luck with your studies!|||No, my SO is extremely high on my priority list. That being said, I've made it very clear from the very beginning what kind of life and lifestyle having a relationship with me meant. I would not be able to live with an SO who would bitch day in and out about my work habits and schedule. My SO accepts these non negotiables however, so I also put him high on my priority list in return. This includes calling off work appointments or leaving work early, no questions asked, and no second guessing myself, if my SO is ill etc and needs my help at home.|||Which damn paintings?

Chubby/overweight? Definitely. Morbidly obese? No. This kind of aesthetic has never gained wide spread popularity in the arts. |||Just my 2 cents, but I took over the bullet journal productivity subreddit (r/bujo) after a bit of subreddit drama with loads of unhappy users and had to implement quite a few of the things you mention + stuff other users are mentioning in the comments. r/bujo in terms of subscribers is about 5x the size of this sub. I added a second mod who shares my philosophy for the sub after about a month and two mods has been plenty with the modqueue being pretty much empty at all times. Frankly, one person could do it, but with two (who operate in different time zones) the work load went from 'it's a bit of a hassle' to 'just checking in if something needs to be done'. We don't do super strict comment section moderation however, like you are suggesting would be necessary for this sub. Before I started adding mods, I started some community discussions about what exactly the users expected from the sub and what they expected from the mod team. This resulted in a very clear (and strict) rule set and a clear vision on what the sub was supposed to be. Only after this was clear, I added my co mod, and even with only the two of us, I sometimes run into some moderation team issues, despite our shared philosphy. For example, when we have to discuss (time zones....) what action to take on unclear issues/requests, or when for example my co-mod accepts/removes reported content and I wouldn't have made the same decision. Especially this last point is important: it happens rarely, because we are *very* much on the same line of thinking regarding the sub. If you have a big mod team, all thrown in together, still figuring out what exactly the way forward is... yeah. I'd anticipate some problems.My advice for you guys: **don't** had 4 new mods at one go. It *seriously* might be overkill and will only result in more overhead and internal modding issues. I seriously recommend u/canyoustop should maybe just add u/factorizotion and have the two of you make a solid foundation, after which you can decide if its necessary to add one other mod and only add even more mods once you have a clear indication of the need for more (wo)menpower. |||Awesome, thanks. Any comment on the adapter hardware itself? Like, are there brands/sites/whatever to definitely stay away from or is it all the same?|||Dear OP, your post was removed as per subreddit rules. r/bujo is a sub dedicated to the use of bujo's as a productivity tool. Any non-productivity posts (such as cover pages or other decorative pages) are not allowed.|||You should start not giving a shit about what your mum and other family members expect and want from you. The reality is, you'll be an adult soon, and you'll be leaving all of them behind to go live your own life. Better make sure that life is what you want, and not what your family wants, as you'll be the one who has to actually live it.Anyway. You're 17. You just finished high school I'm guessing. Did you work hard for it? Did you succeed in getting grades you are happy with? Maybe you have a scholarship or some financial aid lined up already for college? Did you get through high school without getting into trouble with drugs and alcohol? You didn't get (a girl) pregnant? You didn't self harm, or developed a depression? I mean.. if all of this holds true, you're seriously doing pretty damn good for a 17 year old! All of these are things to be proud of. Than, about your degree. You seem to have an interest in many things, but also seem to be stuck thinking 'if I choose compsci, I will spend the rest of my life as a programmer'. This is simply bullshit. A degree is a starting point, after which you still have all the freedom to do what you want. Compsci can lead to a career in management, sales, politics, even marketing, etc etc. I had similar worries and issues at your age. In the end, I was talking to my father and he said: if you don't know what you want to be when you grow up, that's fine, but in that case you should stop trying to pick your degree programme based on your future career! Instead, he told me, I should pick a degree programme, based on characteristics I *did* have an opinion on at this point in time. So I started thinking, what do I want and expect from my degree programme. I figured I wanted a programme that first and foremost leads to good job opportunities. Not like I had to earn buckets of cash straight out of college (econometrics for example), but job prospects should be decent and abundent (so, English history was out). I also greatly cared about educational quality, so I wanted to join a programme that didn't have too many students (as I believed - and still do - that small scale education is best), and had a reliable programme, which meant enrolling for a classic degree programme, and no fancy new age bull shit that has only been around for a few years.In the end, I decided on studying Chemical Engineering. I'm now in grad school, and I know 100% that I do NOT want to be an engineer. But you know what? It doesn't matter. My degree will get me a foot in the door, and on the side, through courses and extracurriculars, I am building up my resume to fit what I do want to get into, which is technology management. The only way I found out what I wanted to do was because I just started on *something* and whenever I got an opportunity to do something new or unfamiliar, I would simply say 'sure, let's give it a try'. Many things I ended up disliking and I dropped those activities very fast and very quickly, but some I liked a lot, so I would expand my activities in those directions. Finishing up my programme now, and I already have a bunch of contacts all over the place, who are standing by with interesting job offers etc. tl;dr: find a a degree that gives you a solid foundation. Anything else is still open, and you will not be locked in at 18 simply for chosing a certain degree. Once you start with your degree programme, keep an open mind and push yourself to try and experience new things. After a few years, you'll finally figure out what you actually want, and with a solid degree, you can still do anything you want.|||By the way, if you're visiting Groningen in autumn and want to hang out and meet some actual STEM students (outside those who are paid to show your around campus) to get to know the ins and outs of Groningen as a student city, let me know.

PS. @laramilo, let your daughter know I wish her the best of luck for her exam! I really hope she gets in!|||That's fair enough. Thanks for answering. :)|||Bacteria builds up over night in your mouth, as you're not swallowing as much (less activity in general, as you're not eating, drinking etc.). So if you don't brush before you go to bed, you're leaving a nice feeding ground for bacteria to grow in, while if you don't brush in the morning, you leave an excessive amount of bacteria grow throughout the day.|||See, this is the cultural difference right here. I commented earlier how it's way more common in the Netherlands to stay at home or at at least work (very) part time as a mother, especially when you're middle class.The income based threshold of getting a bunch of subsidies (child care, child cost, even rent subsidies etc. adds up) or not is solidly on the higher end of middle class. If the mother (or father) stays home or limits their income by working part time, they get a whole tonne of subsidies, while most likely if both had a solid middle class double income, they in the end would have about the same amount of income left, because they'd lose out on subsidies and would have to pay everything out of their own income.The highly educated women work more, also because they earn enough for there to still be a financial incentive to do so.|||I felt confused reading the 'bullet journaling takes too much time' comment as well... bullet journaling was designed to essentially be the fastest, most straightforward way of task management. My bullet journal takes me literally only a few minutes a day (during busy days!), 10 minutes at the start of each month for migration, and maybe 2 hours at the start of a semester as I like to fully map all my course reading, tests, labs, exams etc. so I know exactly what to expect in terms of workload throughout the next months.|||I like it a lot. It's your 'typical' bunch of metalheads, hippies, nerds and all kinds of other non conforming types thrown together and left alone to do their own thing, which is being themselves even if their interests and personalities are a bit 'weird' or strange. You meet a bunch of really unique and interesting people who can throw the craziest parties, but also the most memorable board game nights. Sure, if that's not your crowd, definitely find another place, but for me, I liked it. |||What kind of work placement / field are you in? |||Cool! The offer I made some time ago still stands of course! If you want a 'real life' city or university tour or if I can help in other ways, just let me know. As long as I don't have lectures to attend, I'm happy to show you around. If not: I hope you'll have a great time next month! It's been really cold the past week or two by the way. I don't expect the cold to go away any time soon either.

I can see how from her perspective this behaviour is very much innocent. That being said, it's a very personal thing and how comfortable Dutch are with something like this will vary from person to person.The fact that she's Dutch is something you can use though. The Dutch are very direct without taking offense. You can just outright tell her: hey, I'm not comfortable with you getting undressed in the living room and us accidentally walking in on you, please get changed in the bathroom instead. Very likely she'll just be like: oh, sorry didn't realise it, will do! And she wouldn't feel awkward at all about you calling her out on it.|||The Science and Engineering faculty is the second largest of the university.. besides, RUG is the only university that offers both engineering and non-engineering degrees at the same uni, which is unique on this scale in the Netherlands. With how much typical STEM students find themselves in some kind of superiority bubble, I think it's a *good* thing to study at a comprehensive university to make sure STEM students actually get to know some humanities students to broaden their thinking a bit and maybe even (gasp!) learn some appreciation for non STEM fields.|||Ja, dat is de keerzijde. Maar wat mij betreft een makkelijke keuze: wij willen geen kinderen en ik heb een ambitieus carrièrepad voor ogen waarbij wij om de paar jaar, in ieder geval van woonplaats, maar waarschijnlijk ook van land zullen wisselen. We hebben daarom totaal geen behoefte aan vastigheid, wat toch wel nodig is als je een huis wil gaan financieren. |||I like this comment. After reading the post I was mostly thinking: what's the point if the content already exists on other subreddits? But I think what you're describing is the key difference: it's not necessarily the content, but the perspective of how the audience of this subreddit would view the content. The way women (on this sub) approach FI/RE questions is really fundamentally different from r/financialindependence in general. That should be the starting point of any wiki for this sub.|||Sunscreen is probably the single most important thing you can do for your skin. I do want to cautiously warn you though: the claim of your product having a certain SPF is totally based on a standard amount of product you're applying per square centimetre of skin. For your face (excluding your neck), this is about a quarter of a teaspoon... yeah, it's a lot. I'm commenting because you said you're using an oil based product, and I can imagine maybe not using enough of the sunscreen because it would be too oily. |||It's not just about the net effect. Changes like these cost the industry *a lot* of money in terms of initial development costs for new products, new production processes and also new supply chains. There definitely is a learning effect in which it will be easier for major companies to expand the practice more easily and more cheap in other regions. What the EU is doing is forcing these companies into an incentive to invest in these changes (and likely paying towards helping these companies in all different kinds of subsidies etc along the way because that's how the EU works), lowering the barrier for expansion of policies like these world wide. The EU is taking responsibility for the world wide sustainability problem not by drastically reducing net output because, like you said, we're not a net producer of waste, but by picking up the dirty laundry and the initial bill to initiate change. |||You are reasoning from a very culturally biased perspective though... For example, in my culture, going out to restaurants is done as a celebratory event, or when traveling/on holidays. Same for fast food, that shit is expensive, and people only get it when on road trips, as a rare treat, or at the end of an evening of getting shit faced. Ordering food is a bit more common, but when ordering food for two costs you the equivalent of 4 home made dinners, you think twice before ordering food more often than once every month or two. Everybody packs their lunch, and buying lunch from the canteen is not really a common thing either. And no, I don't *ever* have cookies or snacks at home, nor do my friends, as that's how we grew up. Snacks are only bought for specific moments or activities: a night watching movies with friends, a bbq in the park, a birthday party etc....To say 'a normal, healthy person eats like this, so you need to get used to this'... no, sorry, your cultural normal isn't a universal normal, and to state that it is, might give people the wrong idea of what normal eating habits are.|||Your Dutch is pretty good! Some corrections if you don't mind. Just trying to be helpful, as you're clearly doing your very best to learn! Herinneren can be translated to remember, but in Dutch, 'remembering' is specifically tied to past memories or experiences. In my opinion, 'recalling' would be a better translation to 'herinneren'. In this case, 'herinneren' would not be the best contextual verb to use, although everybody understands what you are trying to say. I would say 'weet dat niet alle Nederlanders zijn zoals hij' or 'in mijn ervaring zijn niet alle Nederlanders zoals hij' or simply 'Niet alle Nederlanders zijn zoals hij'. veel Nederlanders denken dat het raar of dom is **als** een buitenlander Nederlands leert / Nederlands aan het leren isfuck words like 'als' in Dutch language. These are super hard to properly use and position for foreigners. maar als je de taal leuk vindtis dat alles wat telt / alles dat telt (the wat/dat preference might be regional bound, not sure), it's also a bit of a colloquial expression, which makes it even harder (and grammatically weird). You tried to make quite a tough and technical sentence! Piecing everything together:Ja, veel Nederlanders denken dat het raar of dom is als buitenlanders Nederlands leren, maar als je de taal leuk vindt, is dat alles wat telt.Nederlands**e** vriend, Nederlands**e** vriendin, Nederland**s** vriendje.|||This is almost exactly what I stock.. I also stock canned fruits, potatoes (regular as well as 'just add milk' powder for mashed potatoes) and couscous. I keep some spam in my pantry as well, but that's literally the only source of meat I keep. Not sure why OP thinks its so much more difficult to prep for a vegetarian diet. I would say 9/10 meals that I cook are not dependent on meat whatsoever. Sure, I do add meat some days, but the meal can be just as nice and nutritious without it by just leaving it out.|||To be honest, I get where this guy is coming from, as my SO went through it as well. My SO is 6\\\"3 and 250 lbs, but he is *strong*. He works out 3-4 times a week (mostly martial arts), does a daily morning work out of 50 push ups and sit-ups. The guy would weight lift *me* as an exercise for shits and giggles (one-handed, and I was 185 lbs at my heaviest). My SO's legs are ripped and even when relaxed, you can barely even lift his skin of his muscle. Same for his arms. Regardless, he is at the obese threshold at BMI of ~30, and although it's not a lot, he does have some belly fat. He recently needed an abdominal ultrasound, and the doctor noted how he actually does have a bit of a fatty liver due to being overweight. He for years said: this is simply how I'm build, I'm strong and fit, so what's the problem? Well, even if you can't see it from the outside, visceral fat is the problem. He'll likely never be a BMI of 20 because yeah, his natural build *is* pretty big, but he is losing some additional weight. I think once he get's to a BMI of maybe 26 or maybe 27, that should be low enough for him considering his muscle weight.|||Just because I'm curious.. have you ever figured out what (types of) food you overindulge on when you weren't counting calories or whether it was more a mental process of having to hold yourself accountable when logging which fell away when you stopped? I'm like the person you answered to. I counted calories for 6-8 months, after that, I stopped and simply tried to be mindful of my eating because I didn't want to constantly have to think about it and expend all the mental energy on counting my calories. It worked pretty well *for me*, so I'm just curious why it didn't for you. |||Wow. I consider myself quite knowledgable in personal and women's health for a lay person, and I have to be honest, when I read the title, I was like 'haha, look at this idiot who doesn't know the difference between cervix and vagina' (I'm an awful person, I know...). I seriously did not consider that something like HPV could lead to the *actual* removal of your vagina. Damn.Your post definitely educated me. Thank you. You made me really glad I was able to get my HPV vaccine when I was a teenager. |||Well, the obvious answer is: thank you! By the way, I noticed that people who do what you are doing are simply uncomfortable accepting compliments, and have a weird sense of it somehow being rude to simply fully accept and acknowledge a compliment. You could very easily replace your current behaviours of 'rebunking' the compliment, by simply complimenting the person back to have it be a shared thing:'Thank you, that's so kind of you to say!''Thank you, I really appreciate you telling me that!'This way you are also complimenting the other person, but not in a fake, insincerely 'I love your dress too!' kind of way.|||There comes a point when a person can definitely have *too* many unused notebooks.|||Yeah I do. Obviously something went wrong when I was writing that comment.|||You sound really, really young. First off: the difference in interactions between 18-20 year olds is totally different compared to 23-25 year olds for example. It gets better so give it time (or date older people, that's what I did at least).Some things:1. You *will* change direction multiple times over the next years. That's normal and okay. The perfect girl right now might not be perfect in a year or two from now. 2. Quit judging people. It's a bad quality to have, and by only judging people against what you qualify as 'good enough' you will miss out on a lot of opportunities to learn and grow by looking for value in people who are different from you. You are doing you a disservice.3. Solve your own problems first and add a relationship in the mix after. A relationship will not solve your unhappiness or loneliness. Work on YOU and work to be the version of you which you are happy to live with the rest of your life, and multiply that happiness with a relationship with a woman that has the same strength of character and stability in life. |||Reading back your comment more thoughtfully, yeah, I did miss your original point, as it definitely wasn't hostile. I guess your post got caught up together with some ugly PMs I got on the topic when I opened up Reddit which got me riled up. Although I do stand by my experience and point made in general, to direct it at you following your specific comment was uncalled for. |||Damn.. thanks for posting. I didn't realize something 'silly' (from my perspective) like this might have been such a big deal that it required legislation. I'm not American and I live in a place that's very much white. I don't have black friends.. I know very few black people in general to be honest. These kind of posts are very valuable to get more understanding of and insight into what kind of racial issues are present in society. Clearly it's a big deal for you, considering this is your daily reality, but I would have never guessed as much. You taught me something new today, something to think about..|||I can only speak for my own experience (as you'll understand by the end of this comment), but I have been very 'lucky' in having had a rather serious injury in my early 20s. This injury made me undergo half a dozen surgeries in under 2 years, hospital appointments every other week, spending months at a time in a wheelchair, and being in constant pain. It was absolutely awful and I still have pain every now and then because of it, but I am very much grateful for the experience. Two things happened during that time:First, I experienced so many emotions and thoughts I never had before and never stopped to think about. The feeling of helplessness when somebody you barely know grabs your wheelchair to 'help' you, as well as the helplessness when you need help but literally no not a single stranger is around to ask help from. Shame, anger, sadness, frustration, all of it.. I really stopped to think about how lucky I was to be born healthy and got a lot of appreciation for people with chronic health and mental conditions. I also developed a much deeper understanding of what people go through when they have (fixable) serious illnesses or other problems in their life. Second, I got to see what *true* leadership was about. During my time of illness, I was also involved with some high level managerial projects. I had people I already had great respect for (achievement wise) treat me amazingly, as well as as outright shit. I also had people I didn't respect that much treat me in a way that enabled me to still be productive and active within my projects in a way I didn't think was possible. Suddenly I realized the worth and value of these people to an organization, even if they weren't the most amazing strategists in the group. This was an absolute eye opener: empathy is **KEY** to being a good leader. Throughout these 2 years (and many years after still to this day) I started quite an introspective journey in which I evaluated my own empathetic strengths and weaknesses. I knew I wanted to shift my image from some high-achiever who would bulldozer over everything and everyone to get the job one (because that was one of my realizations and people honestly saw me like that), to someone who achieved their goals by lifting up the people around me and leading teams to success.So, how to do this? My main conclusion: I am not a strong empath. I find it *really* difficult to place myself in other people's shoes. What am however really strong at analyzing my own emotional state and needs and using my own experiences as a way to build empathetic frameworks. I'm not a good 'listener' because I find it hard to empathize. I am however very good at working through problems and trying to find solutions. What does this mean for me? I needed to work on *really* focusing and paying attention to the emotional state of people around me as well as team dynamics, and *actively* reach out to those people if I *suspect* something may be wrong with, because I *know* these people won't naturally approach me as I'm not that kind of person. Because I'm not so good at empathizing with them, I instead approach them from a *very* personal space where I open up about my own emotions and experiences and ask them if they maybe feel similar, I also ask them whether I can help them by doing/arranging/approving x and y because I know it would have helped me. I became really proactive about being in touch with other people emotionally, even though I still can't 'connect' with them emotionally.I moved from the person who was known for taking initiative to get the *job* done, to the person became known for taking initiative to maximize the success of the *team*. And this is exactly what I mean with 'what do *you* bring to the table?'. For me the overarching answer is: I am the catalyst for increased team performance. And what does this mean for me:1. I am the person who always ensures all ideas are listened to and everybody is acknowledged for their input and work. 2. I am the person who ensures each team member feels challenged enough as well as supported enough in their work.3. I am the person who people can come to with problems (of any way, shape, or form) and who will make sure this person is supported in a way that benefits both the individual and the team.And I make *damn* sure my worth as an employee revolves around this first, and my accomplishments second. Which is logical, because my accomplishments *follow* from this added value. |||Ik zal beginnen met de vraag: zijn er plekken waar ze vaker kwam in haar studententijd en goede herinneringen aan heeft? Verder: goede optie is zalen in grotere kroegen (Huize Maas, Het Heerenhuis, etc) of juist dealtje sluiten met een klein kroegje om de hele bar dicht te gooien voor een besloten feest. Denk ook eens aan de verenigingen: is ze lid ergens? Miss kan het in het pand van de vereniging. Of anders: heeft Panacea niet een stamkroeg?|||No, as a member state national, there are no requirements on you whatsoever, except being a member state national. Sure, if in time you want to naturalize as a Dutch citizen (and abandon your Irish citizenship) one of the requirements will be a Dutch language test. But you don't need it to be allowed to stay here even for the rest of your life.|||I see you're currently a CS/AI student. Not sure where you are from, but you should realize that CS/AI is literally the only degree with which you will have a decent job prospect after finishing your bachelors, due to the extreme shortages of knowledgeable programmes.You *will* need a masters degree in business if you want to get a decent job. Google FEB Careers Company, they'll have some metrics on each of their MSc programmes with regard to job prospects and salaries. Now about the degree programmes: I study both at Economics &amp; Business and Science &amp; Engineering (both BSc and MSc), and to be honest.. well.. yes, education at FEB is far more structured and expectations are a lot more clear, but the level is low, very low, compared to Science &amp; Engineering. Even now during my masters, where every teacher is like 'omg, you'll have to work super hard and actually put in effort' I'm seriously cruising through not doing jack shit, while still getting high grades (7.5+). When I was still studying BSc Business Administration (which I couldn't finish due to illness) I could seriously do the full study load of 15 ECTS of BA courses on less than 17-18 hours a week, including lectures. I'm definitely not impressed. |||Makes me think of my stepmom, although her situation was the other way around. Similar stats and her coach put her on a strict 1500 kcal plan. She's been pretty fit her whole life before pregnancy, so following the diet wasn't an issue.. except she wasn't losing weight as fast as you'd expect. Even after she doubled the hours she spends in the gym. She had major water retention though that kept getting worse. Her fingers would swell up like little cucumbers.The coach actually told her she probably either had a thyroid or hormonal issue. She went to see her GP and *guess what*, she actually does. So yeah, a medical issue *could* impair weight loss, which is something to check *after* proper restriction doesn't work as expected and the test results should actually tell you whether that's the case or not.|||This stuff is serious. My uni's school paper ran an article on sexual harassment last week. One student had a scarily similar story like you... at one point, the guy turned up at her shared student house. Because they were 'friends' in the past, one of the people in the house let him in. The guy overpowered her and raped her in her own bed. Your fear is not something to push away. Your instinct is telling you some important things. Act on them.|||Reactor and process design was a huge part of my undergrad. I'd guess close to a third of my undergrad courses was reactor/process design. |||I doubt it. I'm mid twenties, my mum started her menopause in her early thirties. Women's health and reproduction is a terribly underfunded and underresearched field.|||Damn. I'm 23 as well, in a relationship with my SO since I've been 18. He's 5 years older than me, and also has a long, long history of depression and suicidal thoughts. In the last years, both of us had have tough times, me due a physical injury needed frequent hospitalization, and him due to a relapse into his depression, which needed intensive specialized mental health care (but luckily no hospitalization). Worst of all: these two things more or less followed eachother directly, so it was extra streneous on the both of us.As a result, we have both been in the situation that the other was fully depended on you, because their health simply didn't allow them independence. Whether physical or mental illness, having to take care of another person long term is very, *very*, (I repeat VERY) hard on the person providing support. It's exhausting, terrifying, and makes you put aside all you want all that you are to take care of the other, just to keep up with the basics of life. Compassion fatigue is no joke. Absolutely no joke. We love each other dearly. That's why we do it. But love is not enough to overcome this. I don't know you, but from your post, you don't really seem to see or even understand how hard is must have been for her to take care of and care for you. You seem to note her actions ('she came to visit me every day'), but you don't seem to recognize how it affected her emotionally, while you do continuously write about your own emotional state ('I love her', 'I feel she's acting selfish', 'I feel hurt'). To be honest, by not recognizing her emotional state at all, you're the one who's being selfish. The thing is, the only reason why we survived this hardship, is that despite everything that went on in our own life, we were very conscious of the other person at all time, and were very aware of what the other person was sacrificing in the act of caring. The person who needed care would voice they appreciation literally every day to the other person, and we would take a moment every (other) day to discuss **both** our emotional states with regard to our relationship so the carer wouldn't collapse under the pressure.We also had a very good support system, who kept each of us in check, and made sure the carer was also taking care of him/herself. My \\\"MIL\\\" who has been through an earlier hospitalization of my SO because of his depression, would often call me to check on me. She would come over once in a while to clean our house top to bottom because I was just in way over my head. And she would sometimes tell me 'Avacyn, I don't care what you think about it, but you need rest, I'm taking my son to our place this weekend so you can have time off'. Both our constant communication and our support system are to thank for us surviving these hardships. Without this, we would **not** have made it. And it seems that this is what has happened to you... The thing is: I can now say with all my heart, if something like this were to happen to my SO again, I would be there for him and we would get through this. The same goes for my SO. Clearly, your fiancee has been thinking about the same scenario and has decided that probably, no, based on this, she wouldn't be able to deal with this again. Which I absolutely can't blame her for. |||So much this. I have both a bachelor in ChemE and industrial engineering. Damn sure I get more interest from companies due to my industrial engineering degree! The thing is, it's not *only* about fixing broken systems, it's about being able to coorporate with managers and other stakeholders and not just fix problems, but fix problems in a way that satisfies all involved non-engineers as well. That skill alone is worth so, so much (and something 'real' engineers often fail at tremendously).Anyway. Being a part of both crowds, I definitely had people shit on industrial engineers. The response of the industrial engineers? 'I can't hear you over the sound of all this money being deposited in my bank account!'.|||When you say 'I actually finish them in a timely manner' do you mean you can handle the work load without 1) running overtime 2) having to work at your max, exhausting yourself because of it day after day? If you can handle the work load just fine: great! Your employer will love you and you'll have a good future at this company. It's very normal for people doing the same job to have different work loads, simple because some people are better at a job compared to others. If you are overburdened by the workload, you should address specifically the work load burden with your boss, not your co-workers performance. Just tell them: in the past weeks, I have been doing x reports per week. Although I managed up till now, it's simply too much for me to take on these many reports week in week out and I am afraid I'm getting overburdened by all of it. I think I can do y reports a week steadily, leaving room for me to give it some extra and get some emergency work in when deadlines are coming close.|||The lack of a masters degree will be an issue. Like you noticed, salary requirements for a Blue card are high, and practically all academically trained engineers will have MSc  degrees.Maybe an idea, which might be a longshot option based on your work experience and PE status: have a look at professional doctorate programmes. Usually these are post-graduate educational programmes of 2 years that require a MSc degree, but who knows.. you'd get a salary from the university by the way. |||I guess this also has a large cultural component. My dad (now in his 50s) got his license at 18, just like I did (now in my 20s). I refuse to ride without my full gear on, as does practically everyone from my generation who isn't part of .. well, extremely low classes of society, frankly. My dad is fine riding with jeans, tshirt and just a helmet. Which I give him a lot of shit about... When I discussed this with him, it seemed that the major difference is that when he was my age, the roads were a lot calmer and more safe in general, while I grew up in urban chaos. Back then, everything was way more laid back, and with nearly empty roads, the safety issue of managing chaotic traffic was less of an issue. I still don't agree, but I doubt I'll ever make him change his ways still.|||I'm commenting to you because top comment: first, thank you for not being a sexist jerk, it's very much appreciated! Second, if you or any other men want to help the women with this sexism problem in STEM, please, and I mean *please* call out other men who make sexist jokes, or sexist remarks. A guy being told by another guy 'Dude, that's really not cool' shuts many of them down real quick. Especially if it's a locker room guy 'joke' when no women are around to begin with and these jokes are used to set some kind of common ground about what is considered funny among men. The problem is, because they are sexist, it won't help if women tell them this, because they don't value our opinion anyway. But if a man tells them, it can really make a difference.Edit, because I hit post too soon: making friends is awkward for all of us. Most women have a radar for creepy guys, and will notice you're not one of them.|||Feelings are hard. Self analysis is hard. And when insight in those areas does come up, putting it into words is also hard. But like anything, practice makes perfect. My SO and I have a rule in our relationship: *anything* that bothered you gets talked about that same day, or you must be willing to put the matter aside without letting it fester and linger in your mind after today. Every evening before bed, we take a moment to drink a cup of tea on our balcony. No devices, no nothing. This is the prime moment for us to discuss things. Sometimes we end up staying outside for hours, sometimes we just sit next to each other in silence for the 10 minutes it takes to finish the tea. Having dedicated 'talk time' improved my introspective abilities a lot, and really strengthened our relationship.|||Dear /u/prprk, your post has been removed under rule 2: post that focus on non-productivity content will be removed. Although you have posted a comment (as per rule 3), it does not become clear how *this* particular non-utilized spread aids in your productivity. |||The fact that you feel you should have to 'quickly hide' a pad is ridiculous to begin with to be honest. I mean, I get it, I do so as well, but that doesn't mean it's stupid regardless. Half of the world population is female. That's A LOT of menstruating women at any given moment. It's not weird, or gross, or whatever. It's one of the most normal bodily function you can think of. Why should we be all secretive about it, while not being secretive about..

Almost everything I saw made me go: ooh, I like this, this would look amazing on my body.|||Good job on getting into therapy, that will seriously be the biggest thing you can do to help yourself. Always remember: we typically say 'go to therapy' as if that's going to solve the problem, but that not true. Going *through* therapy is damn hard work.. the type of work that you can't pin point as 'having done something' but still will in the end lead to results. What I'm trying to say: don't be too tough on yourself, you are probably getting a lot done in a day with regard to working on your mental health, even if you don't feel like you are.That being said, back to productivity. You need to be able to accept that working on your mental health has priority right now in your life. Changing the world is not gonna happen right now so you don't need to focus on productivity on succeeding in 'major life topics' other than mental health. What really helped my SO through his anxiety/depression when he was getting therapy: don't push yourself and demand all kinds of things of yourself (because that's not priority right now), but *do* focus on keeping up with routines. Daily shower, brush teeth two times a day, take a daily 20 minute walk, specific cleaning tasks in your home, etc. (You'll need to figure out what these are for you and your life.)It seems silly to focus your productivity on getting 'the basics' done every day, but being in control of these fundamentals gave him a lot of peace of mind and made him feel grounded and 'in control'. |||This was key for me, or, it became key when I realized I was going at it wrong. You shouldn't stop when you feel *full*, you should stop way earlier. Feeling full is the equivalent of 'definitely ate more than my body needs right now'. Especially when the food is nice, it's so easy to eat until you feel fully satiated. You're not quite bursting (been there as well, plenty of times, like everyone), but still, you tummy is properly filled up and you notice it being filled up. But at that point, you likely already ate way too much, especially as it takes a while for your brain to actually notice you're full and tell you you're full. |||I actually have an opposite rule. I want to experiment more with different aesthetics, as I'm currently pretty dug into my current style (which I do love by the way). I have an amazing high quality, designer clothes thrift store nearby. If I find something that's different and which makes me curious but also slightly uncomfortable, I do buy it because it's cheap, and force myself to prepare several outfits with that item. Most of the times, I end up wearing the item plenty of times to justify the price. It also made me step outside of my comfort zone, only to see my comfort zone expand through exposure. I also have several friends who have my body type, so the items I in the end do not like, I usually give away to friends, which again, is not too much of a problem, because it was cheap to begin with.|||I've seen this post. This user commented on a post about somebody being late to pick up his food at the food bank (for good reason) and being last in line. There wasn't much decent food left and they got all the left overs from very apologetic food bank staff: a stack of 1 person microwave meals, a stack of chicken filet packages to put on sandwiches, and some weird Christmas holidays sugary drinks with glitter in them, and 3 bell peppers. This person was incredibly positive in their sub, being grateful for everything they were offered and talked about how they were going to spread out the meals and what could be frozen for later use etc. Then this CB came along complaining about what they were getting from their food bank, and rather having received the stuff the original OP got. |||The admissions office also has a phone number listed on the website.

I manually approved your post, so it should be visible to everyone else now!|||Oh, yes, men face similar issues. I don't call myself a feminist, rather an egalitarian, as does my SO. We have this deal: my SO (a guy) will fight for women's right by calling out sexist men who mansplain or show other toxic attitudes and he comes up for women's equal opportunity rights whenever he's in public (and private, as he always votes for female politicians for example), and I call out the women who are sexist towards men and come up for men's mental health and reproduction rights (and other remnants of toxic masculinity).In the end, sexism ends up hurting both women and men, and sadly, sexist men don't accept being called out by women and vice versa. We need to tackle this together, each from our own perspective. That's why it's so important that guys do not just toss aside mansplaining like a non-issue, just because some idiot woman uses is like this, invalidating the issues. |||Same here. Had 2-3 years when I needed 8 surgeries, several hospitalizations and just general checks and visits ever 3 weeks or so.. I was keeping up with literature, even asking my surgeons for reading material, and hanged out in the medical university library during my stays (which was located in the hospital itself). My main surgeon was awesome, treated me like an actual intelligent human being. When I told him other physicians and nurses weren't doing to same and it bothered me, he had a note added to my hospital wide, electronic patient file that said something like 'patient has sufficient medical knowledge to have a professional conversation with, treat her as such'. It actually solved that problem almost completely.. until one time, when one of the student had to talk me through something and this student was seriously talking to me like I was 5 years old. Even after I was answering with correct medical terminology, the med student couldn't adapt their communication style. Yeah.. my surgeon had to step in and put the poor kid back in his place. |||In Nederland geldt nog altijd dat je iedere EU student die voldoet aan je ingangseisen (zolang je opleiding geen fixus heeft) MOET aannemen volgens de wet.

Interesting! In that case, a lot will depend on the country of origin national laws. Those who have ratified chapter 1, require proof of renounciation, as condition to get your new citizenship. However, it could work the other way around as well, in which your country of origin assumes automatic loss of citizenship, if you naturalize. In that case, it doesn't matter whether the UK allows dual citizenship or not.  |||Just makes me sad to come across people in 2018 who simply do not acknowledge women are disadvantaged by virtue of being a woman, even if they are good or better than their male counterparts.

Memories from me being an exhausted organic chemistry lab student and being at the end of my rope of trying to manage 8 hours of lab during the day and 4-5 hours of prep and report writing in the evenings, with enough sleep because my body was not used to being on my feet for 8 hours a day.. I never yelled at my TAs, but I definitely felt like it plenty of times.. I also remember being a TA myself and actually teaching labs. I remember how much I was rooting for my students, how much I cared about their education, how much I wanted to do anything I could so they could learn... and how utterly frustrated I got when they - seemingly - didn't grasp even the easy stuff. Because also as a TA: it's hard work, both physically, intellectually, and emotionally. And I remember how I felt when those couple of students throughout my various lab courses over the years would catch me off guard by telling me: hey, just letting you know, but you're doing a good job as a TA, and I really appreciate the effort you're putting in. I got these comments from both my best students, as well as from those who were struggling (and it always felt genuine, definitely not as ass kissing).

One thing to be prepared for: when (not if, you sadly simply need to learn this skill in life as a woman, and especially as a female engineer or scientist) you call them out, be warned that the reflex of guys who tend to openly harass women like this is to start bad mouthing you and maybe even openly calling you a bitch or other names in response.

You should not take such a response personally, you should not believe them, you should not feel bad in any way.. but it is likely to happen, so be prepared.

Sunrise plays a major role in how your body registers time (major element of 'sun time'), so if we keep DST during winter (even though GMT is closer - but not a perfect match - to the 'natural sun cycle' in which high sun is at noon), we will have a big artificial deviation of 'sun' and 'social' time which puts a big strain on our body. |||I've thought about this a lot, especially since I ended up with an INTP guy, so yeah.. quite the opposite.

I've been doing this for 2 years now, and my setup changes whenever my needs change. I had a lot of classes with loads of time sensitive stuff and deadlines to take care of the these past months, so I had a weekly + dailies. Now that I'm mostly working on one major project over a longer planning horizon, I dropped my dailies again. And that's fine! The whole point why I love bullet journaling (opposed to a preprinted planner) is *because* it can change over time.

They'll send it to alterations where they have tailors with serious knowledge of all original patterns do the work on your clothes.

Off my list.Women who are confident in addressing your questions and men being supportive? That's a company I'm interested in.I once mingled with a group of 2 women and a handful of men at a Friday afternoon drinks event. I asked the women a tough question and the women shared some strong opinions on the topic. It wasn't their answer that convinced me to apply to this place in the near future, it was the reaction of the men. They expressed interest in the women and their opinions. That admitted they never thought about the issue at hand, BUT followed up with all the right questions themselves. I didn't have to push the conversation at all, the next 20 minutes was mostly filled with the men asking questions and discussing the topic *together* with the women.

My long term SO is an INTP, and I don't need nor want him to be overly ambitious to become the societal equivalent of 'successful'. What I *love* to do as an ENTJ luckily lines up with that what society values in terms of what's called success, so I'm totally fine with me earning money and my INTP getting the opportunity in life to simply go after what *he* wants (just like I do), not what society expects from him. I've told him time and again: I don't care if you want to be a stay at home husband, or a permanent volunteer at an NGO, or dedicate your life to building an airplane from scratch.. as long as he tries to get most out of his life in an effort to be happy and continuously grow as a human, I would be happy to stay with him the rest of my life.I think the uniqueness of INTPs is amazing. They have this huuuuge, thriving inner life that's weird and strange and deep, which is so unreal for NT types go begin with.

I'm a female in engineering. As someone in STEM it becomes second nature to be harsh and direct. It's not meant to be that way, it's just efficient if both parties agree to leave niceties outside. Anyway. It doesn't work that way. In my experience, when the other party is feeling like I'm combative it's mostly due to them feeling that I'm pushing my own agenda and ideas, without even trying to listen to them. Of course this is not true, but this is their perception and understanding. I follow a new mantra now and it working really well: communication is not about what you are sending, it's about what the other is receiving. If the receiving party does not understand, feel, or experience your communication as you intended, that's on you, not on them, and you should adjust the way you are sending.There is a very simple technique you could use that might help with your CEO. First, carefully listen to your CEO. Don't take notes, fiddle around, or whatever, just focus and listen. And if anything is unclear, ask questions not staements. When CEO is done, you paraphrase what was said and include the phrase 'if I understood you correctly...'. for example,'if I understood you correctly, the problem you are experiences has 3 core problems, which are..''if I understood you correctly, you would like to improve service x under these conditions...''if I understood you correctly, you experienced my communication with you during that meeting as combative because of ... 'Once you made this summation of whatever it is your communication partner has said, you wait for either confirmation or (which happens more often than I like to admit to myself) a rebuttal and further explanation. If you get a further explanation, you paraphrase it again before continuing. After that is done, you can continue with your proposed solution. Yes, it takes more words, but this is still a highly efficient way of communicating as it makes sure both parties are absolutely certain of each other's understanding of the topic and what was decided to do as follow up.As you noticed now, your own efficient way of being harsh might has saved minutes of your time in that meeting, but in the end cost more time and energy due to your CEO coming back to you with complaints, you struggling with that complaint (emotionally, mentally), you posting on Reddit about it.. etc etc. That cost a lot of extra energy which could have been avoided.|||Fresh water pearls are super cheap though!

They need to be willing to fix themselves.

The same counts for you: you need time on your own to find intrinsic purpose in life based on YOU. You need time and space to fix yourself, and go through all the personal development you already mentioned your guy is denying you. You need to find happiness in being happy YOURSELF. You are currently making your happiness totally reliant on your guy's happiness, and like I said above: a (co)dependent relationship is not a good, true, and loving relationship.. But who can blame you. You were a child when you got together with this guy and you don't know better. So I'm telling you now: this relationship you are in is not a healthy one. Or a happy one.

I'd like to bring up another point: cost externalization. Cost externalization is an economic concept that companies can maximize profits by offloading costs unto society, the environment, etc without having to pay for it themselves. It is society/the environment that will have to pay for in the long run, however, tragedy of the commons dictates this is very unlikely to happen. This has a very simple consequence for you as a meat eater: you will pay the price for meat consumption. If not directly in price per kilogram, you will pay it later on in life in having to deal with the societal and environmental cost.There is a solution to this: internalize these costs and be willing to pay the true cost in money upfront for your slice of meat. This is where tragedy of the commons comes in, as even if you'd decide to this, if no one else does, you'll pay the premium price now *and* the externalized societal/environmental cost later on in life, meaning you have no incentive to actually pay the higher price now. This is your moral dilemma. Are you willing to make a small change which in its own will not change the overall output, at a personal cost to you, with no guarantee of a better future because of it? How you deal with this moral dilemma is up to you.I am not a vegetarian. But this is how I solved the moral dilemma for myself: I only buy meat local. Local butchers, who get their meat from local farms, who stand by their word to treat their animals well. This means paying a higher price for my meat, as well as inconveniencing myself by having to go out of my way to visit the butcher instead of buying my meat at massive supermarket X. This resulted in me eating less meat (maybe once or twice a week), despite that I don't necessarily limit myself in terms of how much meat I can eat. Doing so also made me realize that in many dishes meat is way, way overrated and I was just consuming meat out of habit, without actually enjoying and savoring each bit of it.|||Being obese is very much *objectively* unhealthy in the sense that it adversely affects your body. |||Rereading your comments: maybe you are a Te user.. have you considered ESTJ?

Our high school system is government funded (we don't have private schools) and tiered in terms of difficulty. Only the highest tier diploma grants you access to a university. High school tiers are fully merit based (and again: fully funded). The idea is, higher education is a right, not a privilege and every student who has the right qualification (highest tier high school diploma) has a right to attend university. It's good to note that it's the government who makes and organizes the final examinations at the end of high school that determine whether students get their diploma or not. This allows for a nation wide educational standard and also guarantees that all students that have this highest tier high school diploma are actually good enough for university.There are some exceptions to this law. When a degree is very popular and demand for the programme exceeds both the university's teaching capacity AND societal demand for graduates of that program, the university may limit the number of students being enrolled. However, even in this case, the university is not allowed to select students solely on high school grades. They usually have to do some capacity tests and motivational interviews and such. This is done only for a handful of programmes, most notably medicine. Some universities actually just draw names (where higher grades give you a slightly higher chance of being drawn).So, theoretically, if a university suddenly has double the number of applicants, they will have to admit all of them. In practice this doesn't happen, though my university has had some unexpected growth (10-20%) which already puts pressure on resources. But then again, it does mean the system is working, because everyone who wants an education can get one.|||This really does not make sense. In my educational system, we have rigorous government control on educational quality. This means that the degree programme has to have learning objectives (set at European level) for the programme, and explain in concise learning goals for each course how the course units relates to the overall programme. This also means that your exam should test exactly that: the learning goals of that course. The exam is scored on a 1 - 10 scale, and it is very much possible to score a perfect 10 / 10, because that simply means you fully fulfilled all learning goals for that course. A failing grade is also an absolute: you didn't proof you reached the goals, so you have to take the course again, end of story. Each teacher is under the control of an exam committee, who have didactic experts in them to ensure fair exams and fair grading. Teacher can't just do whatever the fuck they want, they have to adhere to a very strict quality protocol. |||https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehh8ZdIMMj4|||I mean, we do right? At least where I am, it's actually quite accepted to call out smokers for example, and we do call out our peers regularly. When standing in a line to wait for a festival or whatever and somebody starts smoking, this person would most definitely be asked to step away because it's not appreciated. We so collectively shame them as a society by not allowing them to smoke inside, or even near entries into buildings. When it's pouring like crazy, smokers need to pick up an umbrella at the front desk and suffer the cold and rain 20 meters away from the building. Hell, my city is planning to introduce ordnances that will effectively ban smoking in public *at all* in the inner city. We are actively telling them: if you want to ruin your health, go ahead, but you're being a fucking idiot.Then again, we also compensate for this by offering free nicotine addiction treatment from our universal healthcare insurance.|||The cravings *will* go away, they always do.. it just takes time and some massive temporary will power. Here's a tip though that helps me through the day, considering you already eat oatmeal for breakfast: I eat little to no dairy, so my protein count is a bit off. I substitute with protein powder. Protein powder is ~100 kcal per serving and comes in various flavours. I have oatmeal (~100 kcal / serving), with a dairy replacement such as soya or almond milk (~50 kcal / 150-200 ml), add some frozen fruits such as raspberries, cherries or blueberries (~50 kcal / small handfull), warm it in the microwave for a minute, and add a scoop of CHOCOLATE flavour protein powder (~100 kcal). This adds up to a 300 kcal breakfast, which is close to what you are eating now, that keeps me full (yay proteins!) and is soooo delicious. I hate morning, I really am not a morning person, and I hate breakfast, but since I started eating this, every time I get up and walk to the kitchen I suddenly remember it's morning again and I get to eat my oatmeal again! It seriously brightens up my day with how delicious it is, and it definitely triggers all the nice feelings of eating sweets.|||I laughed out loud at this post and your examples. I don't think you were harsh *at all*, but then again, this is much more a cultural issue than a type issue. I'm Dutch, your directness would not only be accepted, but quite frankly, even expected.

Although many quit academia after their PhD, to *decide* on a PhD because you wish to become a policy developer or consultant may not necessarily be the most straightforward course to take.. A PhD is not really considered 'an education' on the mainland, more like an actual job, a first step in your career. Junior policy developers etc are usually recruited from the pool of (master) graduates. I know plenty PhD's who went into policy after their PhD after deciding academia wasn't for them, sure, but I know *way* more master graduates who went the same route. This is also a thing to do with the bachelor + master structure. We don't have 'college' that offers some random general education courses. Every bachelor is a set program that focuses on that specific field from day one. Every master is a highly specialized program that builds on the knowledge base from the bachelor (this is why you need a related bachelor to enter a masters program). During your master you will write a scientific thesis under the guidance of academic staff. But as a PhD, you'll be considered a scientist that does independent research, not a student.|||Wow, dude.

Feel free to participate and leave a post/message on the sub regarding what you'd like to see (or not see) in this spin-off initiative.|||Inflatie gaat natuurlijk twee kanten op, waardoor de hoogte schuld an sich ook 'minder zwaar' wordt. Daarnaast is de deadline van 35 vast, daarna wordt de rest kwijtgescholden. Misschien dat we in het staartje dan relatief 'veel' moeten betalen, maar zelfs dan.. Over de rente maak ik me niet veel zorgen: is gekoppeld aan NL staatsobligaties, dus ik verwacht niet dat die plotseling rare dingen gaat doen. En als dat wel gebeurt, dan hebben we met z'n alle grotere problemen. Geen idee eigenlijk hoe het zit met draagkrachtvrije voet. Ga ik uitzoeken!|||I wasn't exactly sure of the exact path, but I knew my general interests and I knew my career would be important to me and would claim a lot of my hours. Also, I knew I wanted to work abroad a lot. This of course leads to a certain relationship dynamic your SO needs to be willing to deal with.As it's looking right now, I'm probably going to start my career at a major strategy consultancy firm.|||I'm into 'modern vintage' as I call it, in which I use traditional 50s shapes mixed with a modern business feel to it and a modern colour palette. My fav webshop caters specifically to the vintage crowd. It's a Dutch webshop (but they ship globally) and they're called TopVintage.|||Dear u/_minaegi, your post has been removed as per rule 2: cover pages are not allowed on r/bujo. |||You... sound very exhausting to be with. I don't know, you seem to get hung up with shit that happens, and cling on to shit happening for dear life, instead of just acknowledging shit happened and dealing with it, trying to make the best out of it. Your birthday: you indicated you just wanted to hang out at a hotel, and without further instructions, your guy went ahead to plan a nice day for you. But, it was not what you wanted, while he couldn't have known your issues with that particular hotel. Instead of just getting over that hotel, you spend your day sulking and bringing over your mood to other activities that day. Falling asleep: ... it happens. Unless it happens every single week, is this really that big of a deal? You still went on your date right? Was your date fun in itself? Why let yourself get so down about him accidentally falling asleep, opposed to focusing on the fun date?The car thing was shitty I must say. Even if plans changed, he could have still invited you over to just hang out with you. He definitely could have been more proactive, especially if you expressed to him when he called you that you were disappointed about it. But again, in general: plans change, that's normal and it's not healthy to get so hung up on the plan having been changed to a point you take that mood with you to anything else that follows. Maybe go with the flow a bit more?|||I didn't take offense, if anything, I felt bad for the guy when my surgeon had to step in.. it was clear to the guy the surgeon thought he fucked up. He was a pretty young guy as well. Wouldn't surprise me if he just followed some patient communication training stuff in which the students are actually taught to speak with their patients in a more... simplistic way, because lets face it, for the majority of your patients (highly educated or not), that's whats needed and expected of you as a physician. |||As a young woman who's now graduating to become an engineer in a very male dominated field. Thank you. Seriously, I felt a pang in my heart reading this and thinking: shit, he gets it, he actually gets it. I had to face *a lot* of subtle, societal discrimination growing up. Subtle stuff: comments from aunts when they bought me a girl's make-up set for Christmas, comments on the playground made by the boys, my maths high school teacher subtle asking me if it wouldn't be better if I'd reconsider my choice of taking advanced maths.... My memories from a very young age (and all the way up to my reality right now) are full of these moments that always told me: you might like this, but you don't belong and aren't supposed to like this, why can't you be *normal*? There is one reason and one reason alone in my life why I got to bite through all of that and become an engineer: my dad. My dad - like you - saw what was happening, he *understood* what was happening, and every time he saw me sulk he got up and pushed me to build something, invent something, discover something together. When I told him about my maths teacher, he got angry and told me in no uncertain terms that I COULD do it and I WILL do it, because I was smart and competent and I was going to proof her (yes, my maths teacher was female...) wrong and nothing was going to stop me. He was my biggest support and very vocal about how my dreams and ambitions were valid, despite being a girl in today's society. If you ever decide to have children in life (and if not: that's totally valid as well), I truly hope you'll be blessed with a daughter. Whether she becomes an engineer or coder or a nurse or primary school teacher, it doesn't matter. What matters is that men like you will raise their daughters to make a change in this world. |||Well, if you have a strict limit on your time, there is only so much you *can* do. I wake up at 7am and go to bed at 11 pm. Everything in between is fair game. If my schedule is 'full' and I'm asked to add to my schedule, I have three options:1. Either improve the time efficiency of something I'm already doing (not always an options) 2. Scrap something I already planned on doing (also not always an option)3. Say no. Not sure if that's what you're asking though.|||Upvote for 'lumpectomy'. Thanks for making me laugh when reading the comments on this rather depressing topic.|||They are though.. There a several major student housing projects being build as we speak, each of each will add several hundred of additional rooms. It just takes 2-4 years to build.. |||I hope at least coming here gave you the chance to make some Dutch friends though, you sound fun enough (for a Finn... ok, mean, just kidding of course)! You should push your Dutch friends to practice Dutch with you some more! The Dutch language is seriously quite interesting when you learn it as a foreigner to some degree of fluency, because loads of this small cultural elements which the Dutchies themselves don't noticed are also actually embedded in the language itself.By the way, the grading stuff. As a Dutchie, my response would be to just directly email my prof stating: Your official 10 days passed, when can I expect my grade? Or, you promised some readings, they are not on nestor yet, when will you post them? For many Dutchies, emailing a reminder which includes no more niceties than essentially 'oi you, you promised shit and you forgot' is not rude or anything. Goes back to the 'be responsible for your own info' mindset. |||I second the other comment you got. It might be worthwhile to have a look at your protein content of your meals in general. If the only protein you get is from meat in terms of feeling full, you're likely eating *a lot* of meat to begin with, which has health implications in itself as excessive meat consumption is proven to be very bad health wise in the long run. Another problem in this regard is that we as society have 'forgotten' what a 'normal' portion of meat looks like because of nutrient imbalance as well. I'm not saying stop eating meat (I'm also a meat eater!), but maybe just have a look at whether next to your meat, your meals are balanced in nutrients. |||The way how my mind somehow can be totally taken over by my (obsessive) need for daily work efficiency and my ridiculously high academic and professional standards. Somehow, taking care of myself mentally and emotionally doesn't fit in that mind set and I often forget about taking care of *me*, next to taking care of work. I'm getting better at it, as I don't crash and burn that often anymore.. especially since I've found myself a SO who at times simply physically lifts me up from my office chair to carry me to the couch for some Netflix (and potential chill), while I'm loudly complaining to him 'but I just **can't**, I'm working!' and with him complaining loudly back at me 'I know, you're **always** working!'... yeah.. sadly he's right.. |||Hey, something I can actually weigh in on! When I went after my Serbian citizenship I figured it should be easy enough. My whole maternal line are ethnically Serbian, but my mum never declared her nationality (or got a passport) after the disintegration of Yugoslavia and she subsequently never applied for my passport. Anyway, that turned out to be one clusterfuck of rules and in the end, I couldn't apply through that route. Took quite a few trips to the embassy to figure this out, as the embassy was clearly not used to dealing with cases of people wanting to *get*  Serbian nationality. Anyway. Serbia has a very generic, catch all 'Serbian diaspora' law. Show you have strong ties to the Serbian ethnic group, and you'll be granted nationality.For me: my mum's birth certificate and my baptismal certificate of the local *Russian* orthodox church I was baptised at were sufficient to get approved.It's *way* more expensive to get citizenship this way though compared to birth right provides. I think in total, for the procedure plus getting all the documents I needed, it easily costs 400-500 euros.|||So, take the current status quo: you can only redditrequest this sub if u/canyoustop has not been active on reddit for an x amount of time. Her not having posted recently does not mean she isn't actively moderating this sub, you just can't see it so you're also not sure about whether she's active or not. If the modlog was public, you could actually see what u/canyoustop has been up to (or has *not* been up to...). It would help your case if the modlog was public and would make the decision to start a spinoff sub (like another comment suggested) a lot more justified.Publicmodlog is not automod by the way. I don't use automod on my sub (currently at least, might for weekly posts etc. in the future)! Publicmodlog has NO mod privileges. It can't do anything, *except* view the mod log. That's it. It reads the mod log and makes it public. You can view the mod log on a separate website. It doesn't interact with the community, the only thing it does is publicizing each action a moderator has done *in name of the sub and community*. I'm not saying I'm seeing issues right now, I'm saying transparency should be the default and that there are reasons for subs like this one which makes it even more important. |||Just saying.. But you do realize this is illegal right? Not saying it doesn't happen irl, but maybe not the best thing to arrange through a public forum.|||It's good to see you're already in therapy. You say you can't commit to that what your psychiatrist is asking of you. Reality is: You can. You must. You might find everything your psychiatrist is telling you ridiculous, but consider this: you've been trying to solve your problems on your own, using methods that make sense to you, and failed. Maybe, just maybe, this psychiatrist that has these crazy ideas of methods that might help is actually on to something.Anyway. It falls to you. Your psychiatrist won't make you feel better or see the world differently. They can only give you the tools needed for you to do the work. But *you* need to put in the work. And you can.

Why would you want to have schizophrenia intentionally? 20 minutes later after browsing the sub and Googling about tulpas I came to the conclusion I might actually have a tulpa myself already. This was a really weird experience.. I never thought of my 'tulpa' as an additional personality, but it makes a lot of sense to do so actually.. definitely food for thought.|||If it makes you feel better, my SO and I are living in the Netherlands and have been for all of our lives, and last year the same thing happened to us. We simply forgot almost everything would be closed during that holiday. The only thing we got going for us was knowing exactly which supermarkets/pizza places/etc we had to check because we've been living here for so long. |||What are the goals and objectives of the society you want to start?|||So, here's the deal about EU education, and specifically the countries you mentioned (Netherlands - where I'm from, Germany, and if I remember correctly, Scandinavian countries have the same system as well):Our higher education is tiered. Unlike in the US where you either have the option between 'college' or learning a trade, we have various different options for higher education. Roughly, you can find three categories: trade schools, applied science institutions, and academic institutions. To keep your mechanical background in mind, here are some examples of jobs related to each of these three categories:- Trade  - car mechanic, maintenance mechanic- Applied sciences - production engineer, field engineer, project engineer- Academic - engineering design, project management, researcherBoth applied sciences institutions and academic institutions may grant bachelor of science diplomas. But, if you want a job on an academic level, yes, you will need a masters degree. This has some historical background: the EU wide bachelor/master structure was rather 'forced' upon us, as we already made this distinction between applied science/academic education. Because of this, the status of an 'academic BSc' is rather artificial as it is very much expected of these students to have a MSc when entering the job market.A Dutch academic BSc is not considered competitive for the jobs listed as matching to applied science diplomas. Why? An academic BSc takes 3 years and is highly theoretical, while the applied science BSc takes 4 years and has major practical components in the curriculum. Why would an employer pick an academic BSc graduate with no experience whatsoever over an applied science BSc graduate? They won't, because it's not the purpose of the academic BSc diploma to enter the labour market that way. Where does this leave you? Well, it depend on what kind of career you want. If you want to do innovative engineering design projects: best to get a MSc in the country you want to settle in. If, however, you see your career more in line of becoming an 'all round' mechanical engineer (as we say in Dutch 'you like working with your hands'), a MSc might be overkill and you're probably better off getting some work experience and applying straight for in demand (visa applicable!) jobs.|||Yeah, we've been together for six years now and still very much in love and happy. Learning to communicate was probably the most difficult thing we had to do (and we also faced some major hospitalization and recovery on my part, and extensive treatment for depression on his part over the course of our relationship, but communication was still the toughest thing). We both feel it was worth every single struggle we had, and we often comment on how our current happiness in our relationship is a direct result of all the effort we put into our communication skills.|||Wow. You're assuming an awfully lot about me. First of, I'm not American.I am the child of an immigrant mother and white father. Both in primary school and high school I had sexist, racist teachers who where trying to undermine my education because of my background. The only reason why I got the right papers to attend university was because my cis white father took a stand for me at every single turn and was prepared to do anything necessary to give me all opportunities needed. We were not a rich family, quite the opposite, and no women-only scholarships where I am at at all. I'm taking out loans and am in the upper maybe 5-10 percent in terms of loan size, just to be able to get a degree. Then I finally got to university. I stopped counting the number of times I got harassed by class mates who obviously (maybe subconsciously, maybe consciously) did not think women should be in engineering. I had *professors* make sexist jokes like it was nothing every day of class and have all men laugh at his jokes, while the women looked at each other like 'really? again?'. When you had to chose a thesis advisor, was 'must treat me equally despite my gender' one of your main parameters? It was for me and many of my female peers. We got together many times to discuss which courses to take/not to take, which supervisors to chose/not to chose because of these harassment issues. That kind of stuff is what women in STEM have to consider and take into account. Despite that hostile environment, I got my degrees (unlike many others who couldn't deal and dropped out), and went to grad school. After all of this shit, I DAMN well will take advantages of the single good thing I have going for me for being a female in engineering now that all these companies are like: 'why on earth are there so few female engineers?'. |||Weekends are there to get your life in order so you can conquer the world during the week. |||It's pretty much uniform across the whole European continent. The [treaty](https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/rms/090000168006b659) to reduce multiple nationalities was signed in 1963.Article 1.1 states:The countries that signed it have integrated the treaty in their own national laws. The treaty recognizes jus sanguinis, so if you have birth right to multiple citizenships, no one will take those away from you, simply because the individual constitutions don't allow it. However, if you naturalize, things are different. In most countries though, you always retain the right to 're-naturalize' to your country of origin/birth, based on your birth right, if at any point you decided to relinquish citizenship of your country of origin/birth. If you wish to 're-naturalize', you again need to relinquish the citizenship you currently hold. I'm not sure why you call it a Germany thing though. Germany has the same laws, in line with the Strasbourgh treaty. There are some exceptions, for example in the case of having a Moroccan citizenship, as Moroccon law states a Moroccon citizen is simply not able to relinquish citizenship. So yeah, in those cases, you can naturalize to become a German citizen, while retaining dual citizenship. Another exception would be if you can proof relinquishing citizenship will cause undue burden, for example if your your right to inheritence is tied to your citizenship. These exceptions are - if I remember correctly - also part of the treated, and also quite uniform across the continent.|||Yeah.. even r/loseit is *full* of people with stories of how they lost 100lbs in 8 months only to gain it all back and having to try losing weight again for the second (or third) time.Any 'dieting' that will not result in permanent change to your diet will make you relapse.. I can fully believe that metric of 95% of dieting attempts resulting in no permanent weight loss, considering how widespread fad diets are and how many times people go on diets to lose maybe 20 lbs just for a special occasion (and go into a crash diet for it). |||I always thought the headaches can only be diagnosed as a migraine if they last between 4 and 72 hours.

Would be nice to make a note of why a day was a really good day so you can look at back when you're a bit down and need to be reminded that actually a lot of good is going on in your life as well. |||The university by law needs to accept any Dutch/EU student who applies and is eligible to enter the degree programme they applied for. It's not something the uni controls or even can control. Also, to be honest, I've spoken to many of these students myself, and almost all of them who had trouble finding a room only started looking for one in August... of course you won't find a room by then anymore, that also what the university tells you in writing the moment you apply as an international. As much as can be said about the university's responsibility in this, in my opinion even more can be said about a students' own responsibility in this matter. |||Your ENTJ description is bang on for me.

In my opinion, the best jobs in Groningen (in terms of money, but also experience) are teaching assistant jobs. From what I have seen, CS/AI use large numbers of TAs in their programmes and as a CS student you'd probably also be eligible to teach maths courses (for non-math degree students), which is another major pool of TA positions. TA positions pay really well (~12-13 euro per hour from the top of my head?) and typically they are quite generous with handing out hours, so you'll definitely never be underpaid for the amount of work it takes. That being said, for obvious reasons, you can not be a TA in your first year. In my programs however (engineering), they do *allow* 2nd years to teach even if they don't actively promote it among their students. More like: the professors and TAs do some scouting among the first years and make some unofficial short lists of the students they think would be good candidates to already start teaching in their second year. |||Just something to think about.. do you have any large (student) debts? You'd be looking at salaries of probably around the 40-50k Euro / year mark, of which 30-35k Euro / year would be your take home pay.

If wouldn't be the first time people post on this sub with 100k+ student loans, without realizing there is a massive difference between EU and US salaries. If you have these kinds of debts, you might simply not be able to pay them off on EU salaries.|||So how do you deal with dinners outside of your own home, where food is being served you don't usually eat and don't have the opportunity to weigh?|||In Dutch law, rental contracts are meant to protect the person who rents to room.

That doesn't mean *you* can't break the contract early!If by any chance your contract states that you can't break the contract, in most cases that clause will be null and void because it's illegal to do so. Under typical circumstances you can break the contract with a months notice. If I were you: dig up the contract and take it to Het Juridisch Loket (Google it).

If it was last minute, I would not expect him to attend. He on his turn, would do his absolute best to come with me, and actually interact. We also had the understanding  that the day after I asked him to come with, I would give him lots of space and freedom to recover and rest, without bothering him about things like dishes  or grocery shopping etc. There a couple of times when he decided on the day itself to no go anymore, because everything was just too much. Those were few and far in between though, and he was always very apologetic about those times, because he knew he fucked up.Depression and anxiety are no joke. I just wanted to post this as an example of someone dealing with the same issues who *did* manage to have a workable solution to his problems.

If I would *choose* to this is arguably unnecessary major surgery, would that mean all of that is a lie and I was being a hypocrite? I am a good and truthful person, I don't want to be a hypocrite.Anyway, I ended up doing it anyway. Recovery was long and painful. In the end, not a lot has changed, except that subconsiously I became even more secure and selfconfident, as afterwards I realized that I unconsiously would adapt quite a bit to not show of my smile.

Even if you use your partner's name in day to day life, your partner can still have your maiden name show in their passport. Honestly, I would just send them an email stating; ' I used my maiden name on my application, even though I'm currently using my partner's name which is also the name stated in my passport (if that's the case).

Groningen is de enige uni die zowel scheikunde en scheikundige technologie aanbiedt, en scheikundige technologie opleiding heeft dan ook een flinke focus op productontwikkeling i.p.v. een traditionele process technologie focus. Binnen de opleiding scheikunde kun je in je tweede/derde jaar een track kiezen die 'chemistry of life' heet. Deze track richt zich op biochemie met een flinke dosis pharmaceutical sciences/biomolecular sciences. Als je besluit in Groningen te blijven voor je master kun je met een BSc Scheikunde ook direct doorstromen naar een MSc biomolecular sciences of MSc medical pharmaceutical sciences als je je keuzevakken in je minor goed kiest. Overigens: er zijn best wat studenten hier in Groningen die een dubbele bachelor scheikundige technologie + scheikunde doen! Zeker een uitdaging, maar haalbaarder dan je denkt en wel heel erg gaaf om te doen.

Apparently my upper arm bumps and my face flushing red each and everyday are the same fucking thing. Oh well. Mystery solved I guess.|||OP, I got an idea! If I remember correctly, you can still enroll for FEB courses for block 2a which start in a week or so. Pick a random course from the first year economics curriculum and just enroll to see if you like it. If you do, just go ahead, study for it and pass the course, the credits will still count after you switch, if not, just drop it and look for other solutions to your problem.|||Depends. What is your career and educational background? Like, if you are a decent coder, there is a bunch of work to be found and these companies really don't care about you not being able to speak Dutch.|||About 4 years post-op I find I can walk again without major pain or joint popping. So I decided to walk. I have a hike in mind I want to do. The hike is 55km long so I have a long was to go still before I'm ready. But by now I'm doing a weekly continuous 10k walk, and will probably move towards 15k maybe next month or so. I'm getting there..  slowly. Although I'm still not 100% sure I'm physically able to even do the hike I have in mind, I am not yet at the limits of what I *can* manage.I also started doing pilates! It's actually a pretty tough workout! Pilates was developed for treating war veterans with physical trauma and is zero impact for this reason. I can't do all of the exercises but that's ok, everything is very adaptable to your needs and abilities. I definitely recommend it. I guess what I'm saying is: once your body is ready after fixing those ligaments, just do what you *can* and push yourself to do what you can do really well.|||*Maybe* if he wanted you to be able to clean, he shouldn't have nearly broken your hands, or beat you into having concussions, or beat you into getting organ damage.... Why are *you* feeling guilty if all of this was preventable from *his* side?Please stop saying to yourself he just 'hit' you. What this monster did to you goes far beyond a slap in the face (which in itself is inexcusable and grounds for divorce). This monster beat you up to the point of torture. It is very possible you sustained serious lasting damage. Please take care of yourself and make sure you receive any medical care (both mental and physical) you need.|||That's not intuitive eating though, but following your appetite. Even if you wake up actually hungry (few people do) I doubt you still feel *hungry* after a normal sized breakfast, even if you still crave for more food. Intuitive eating tells you to only eat when hungry and only eat so much as to keep the hunger away.Intuitive eating has a lot of truth to it. It's just a shame how the HAES community ruined its meaning.|||When the scientific method meets gaming fanatics. &lt;3Seriously, this reads as an actual research update given during some kind of research group meeting.

If you tell them up front you have a dog, they might refuse to rent the place to you (which is their legal right), but after you signed the contract, they legally can't do anything to stop you from bringing in the dog with you.|||Thanks for the link! I'll definitely take a look.|||Definitely female. The tampon alone makes it worth it to carry the tin around, and if not for me, there might be another woman around who needs it. |||Dear OP, I've removed this post as per subreddit rules #2 and #3.|||I feel stupid now. This makes so much sense which I didn't think of yet. Either take the BOB with you when you suffer from an injury at home, or ask your SO to bring it once you're at the hospital, and you're sure you'll at least have the short term basics.|||I'm in a country where tipping is very much not the norm, so this is an honest question: especially if booth rentals are the norm, how on earth does tipping make sense? This person would set their own rates and, unlike US servers, don't get paid far below minimum wage because the law allows it due to tipping practices. IMHO (and my cultural perspective) they should just set their rates to a fair price instead of expecting tips.|||Bingo. It's called keratosis pilaris. Or keratosis pilaris rubra faceii when it's on your face. KP for short.I have the same, but no actual bumps in my face, only a lot of redness.|||I totally hate what the popular version has become, but do consider having a look into the (original) bullet journal system. Nowadays, it seems like the whole bullet journal community is filled up with people who only care about making pretty drawings, but at it's very essence, it's a super effective productivity tool. I've been using it for years during my time at university. If you don't know already, the bullet journal system is a 'to do' type journal, in which you continuously migrate your to dos to the next month/next week/next day (whatever your specific setup is) so you don't loose track of anything. Deadline in 3 months? No problem, I put it in my long term tracker and move it to my monthly tracker once that month comes around.You can do this in any blank journal and the customization is super valuable.. Some of the custom things I use in mine: at the beginning of each new semester, I take a few pages to make an overview of each and every deadline for each and every course. I also make a table in which I make an overview of all the grades for my courses, and fill it in throughout the semester. I refer to these pages continuously throughout the semester. I also have a page in which I log my hours for work and research.|||I have some advice, but it might not be useful to you in the short term... In my first year at uni I became friends with several other amazing, young women and also got to know their amazing, loving families. Especially their mothers always ask about me and I always enjoy chatting with them. They are - through everything they hear about me through their daughters - up to date with my life and when they see me, they always ask about my life and are incredibly encouraging. I know for certain if I would call up one of my girls and ask her 'hey, weird question, but I'm really in need to chat with an adult about X, would you ask your mum if she minds chatting with me about it?' it wouldn't be weird *at all*. These are of course a special kind of friendships, but these friendships aren't necessarily rare. It will take time to build such friendships and relationships, but once you do, they are a great source of emotional support you aren't getting from your parents.Other than that, I want to tell you this: when I read your post, the only thing I was thinking was 'wow, you are only 18 years old and already kicking so much ass by going after what *you* want and fighting for it'. What you are doing is extremely special and amazing. I'm certain if you continue down this road and *trust* yourself and your decision-making, you will definitely succeed, regardless of what your parents think.|||Definitely! That's why I started out with the remark 'I see you are studying CS/AI at the moment' to OP, especially because OP isn't commenting about wanting to switch due to difficulties with maths, but due to the organization of the programme. Like I said several times now: educational quality is definitely high (again, didactically its way, way better than science and engineering) but in OPs case, which is having a STEM background, the challenge might not be there. Just giving my experience to OP coming from a very similar background.|||This is incredibly location and field dependent... where do you want to work? I can tell you that for example the field I am in, you won't even be considered without an university masters degree, even though the American branch of these companies mostly hire their new people after a bachelor degree.I think you'll get way better feedback if you post this question to subs specific for your field and make it clear what your preferred location of work is.|||Nope! I guess it must suck to not have institutional disadvantage at your side. Wanna trade? |||Dear u/VRBlend, your post has been removed as per rule 2 (all content must be productivity related). |||I'm just putting this out there because I recognized this: When I learned that: 1) my view of the 'grand scheme' is not necessarily objective.2) my way of problem solving in the context of my view on the grand scheme is not necessarily the *only* way to solve the problem I started to realize that multiple 'truths' can coexist, without either being more valid or more correct than the other, just different. This was a major (and I mean **MAJOR**) step in my personal development, both intellectually, morally/ethically, and interpersonally. Its not just about you arguing for 'step 4' while the others are at 'step 1'. You should consider that the others might actually be at 'step 8' but are looking at things from a totally different point of view. Also: why do you need to 'win' the argument? Once I realized the above, my view on why I argue changed. I now argue because I want to learn and discover new view points, not to 'win' (whatever that meant..). It changes the dynamic dramatically.|||Ok, listen, high school chemistry is the most stupid shit ever and does not compare to actual university level chemistry education. This is coming from someone who *barely* passed high school chemistry, decided to start with a chemistry degree anyway, switched to chemical engineering after a year, and is now graduating with a masters in chemeng. Anyway, you won't find any degrees that will really specialize in cosmetic chemistry, because it's such a niche. If you want to go into actual R&amp;D and product development, I would say, choose chemistry, and not Chemical Engineering *unless* you find a university that offers a ChemEng degree that **explicitly** focuses on product engineering (opposed to the more traditional process engineering), which could be more interesting than pure chemistry.One thing you should keep in mind though: I was always very focused on 'why am I learning this, why is it useful, how can this be applied?'. It was exactly this attitude which made me switch from chemistry to chemeng, as I just didn't have the innate passion for fundamental chemistry in itself. I'm really not a scientist, much more an engineer. If you're worried about this, maybe be on the lookout for universities that offer both degrees and allow you to switch. The field of material sciences is much less interesting for you, as it is very much a field dominated by physicists, and - in my opinion - mostly a purely scientific field, and not yet very applied. Even when it gets to the more applied stages, I still expect it more to go towards electronics etc, and not necessarily cosmetics. If you are considering doing a double major, instead of doing a double STEM degree, maybe you could consider doing a chemistry/business (marketing!) combination instead. This would seriously make you an interesting candidate for the cosmetics industry.|||Even if you have a hormonal/thyroid issue, you'd still lose weight. Honestly, it's simple physics. Your body burns energy to simply exist and needs to get that energy from *somewhere*: either food or fat. Your body might not burn the food you eat as efficiently, or conditions that make your appetite sky rocket making it difficult to understand hunger ques from your body causing you to overeat while still being hungry, or you might have other issues (see below for example) which artificially keeps your weight up, but calories in = calories out and your body *is* burning fat when you're eating less calories than your are consuming - even if the scale isn't moving. Example: My stepmum was on a diet + exercise (all with medical supervision) to get back in shape after having a baby. She wasn't losing weight *as fast* as you'd expect and as she was losing weight, she started blowing up like a balloon due to water retention - keeping her weight up. That's when her coach asked her to get checked out and yep, she turned out to have a hormonal issue.|||I get this. My advice: get physical exercise. It might balance your focus by also focusing on the physical. In the end we very much *are* our bodies. I get that this isn't advice that directly *solves* your problem or question, but I do think it could be beneficial to finding a solution. If you don't like the gym or classes, just take walks. Also counts. |||So clearly this university just has a really bad programme. Staying will mean a semester delay, so why not consider starting a similar masters degree at another university? Many unis allow enrollment at the start of each semester. You might just take December to travel to different cities and have a look at programmes elsewhere. If you do leave however, you should consider writing a letter/email to the counselor and relevant student body on your experiences. This is not ok, and from my experience, change comes slow at universities, but change does come and usually starts with students like you speaking up.|||I actually have that primer! Also, I don't like using green concealer, because with KP the facial redness is even more evenly dispersped across the face compared to for example rosacea. It's not a specific spot or zone, it's just an even red glow. That means I would have to slather the green concealer all over the place, which doesn't work of course, especially because I have a very light skin with cooler undertones, so the green also kind of fucks with my natural skin tone colour as well. I use Estee Lauder Perfectionist. I like the light texture, it's definitely not as full and heavy as for example Double Wear. (and yes I checked, both primer and foundation are silicon based, so they should match.) The colour I think is a decent fit. Like I said, my skin tone is on the cooler side, but it's not what I would call a cool undertone, so I'm kind of in between undertone colours. I picked up the warmer shade, because it deals with the redness better, as the cooler shade simply doesn't deal well with redness. I'm glad you noted the 1.5 pump. That's about the amount I use ass well with my foundation. Clearly, I'm not using *too* much of the stuff. Maybe it's just in my head. From what kind of distance to the mirror are you able to actually *see* your foundation? Can you describe what it looks like to you?My skincare routine is on point. Thanks r/skincareaddiction. |||I have lived in this city my whole life and even I am not always sure about this.

It's absolutely normal to have that happen.|||It does feel damn nice though to be picked up and twirled like a princess, or getting airlifted into a bear hug, or running up to my guy to do a piggy back ride, or sitting on his shoulders at a festival. Being silly together is the best. I consider myself incredibly lucky my guy was still able to do all of this when I was at my heaviest (~190 lbs). It's only become easier for him after losing weight, which means even more frequent and impromptu silliness. |||This. The first generation of women who were born into (relatively) equal access to education and other key freedoms such as reproductive control are only just now building up their careers... and somehow we find it surprising that these women do not have the same wealth/status that took men several generations to build? |||Dear u/princessofsalt, your post has been removed as per rule 2: cover pages are not allowed on r/bujo.|||I mean, asking 'are kids worth it' to parents is kinda pointless isn't it? I mean, it's not like you can suddenly go back on their decision and change their minds about it now... The whole birth hormone tsunami exists to make women (and men) bond with their child, and essentially forget all the pain and suffering of childbirth so women don't actually straight up abandon their children. These hormones don't stop working after giving birth either.. Of course there people love their children and will truly believe they are worth it, because they are their *children*. I'm childfree, but I'm sure that if I were to have a child, I'd love the kid like crazy and will also think 'it's worth it'. That still doesn't mean I should have children or should want to have children. |||The joys of being a female grad student in STEM... I would probably have said something like: dude, really, that's rude. Your face is also a distraction but you don't hear me commenting about it either, do you? The other guys and probably even the professor would laugh, I'd regain some dominance and status in the group (because shit jokes are apparently how STEM guys communicate and build rapport), and I'd feel shit the rest of the day that this was even necessary. |||What are the 3D printing projects you're working on? |||What about chosing a university degree that somehow requires a (short term) international relocation?

Again, you must realize, that the next moment you step foot outside of SA, even if your dad is with you, they have no power over you. You can simply decide to not get on the plane back. You can say you need to go the the bathroom, get in a taxi and go to the airport to get a plane to the UK or whatever. No one can stop you. Even if your dad finds out and tells you you can't go, it doesn't matter, because he has no say over you outside of SA. Just make sure you have some money, hide it somewhere.. even if it takes you another year or 2 or 3 to get an opportunity to step foot outside of SA, it doesn't matter, you'll get your chance. |||I don't know you, but my friends who struggle with this, all have the same thing in common when it comes to perfectionism. Although they would *always* tell me their perfectionism forces them to live up to their personal standards, it actually never is. They internalized societal/outside standards (or perceptions of what those standards are), and have claimed them to be their own, individual standards. As a result, they keep chasing the 'I should.. ' feeling. I should be more productive. I should make more money. I should be prettier. I should have put in more hours. I should have been more succesful. etc. etc. etc. And if they don't succeed, they consider themselves a failure. The thing is, you have nothing to proof in life to other or society, only to yourself. When it comes to planning and productivity, I think that's the first step for perfectionist. You need to figure out what your own, true individual standard is. You could start using a bullet journal, and make *Very* specific goals for your days. Things like: get up at 8 am, work on project x for 3 hours, vacuum the living room, get items a,b,c from the grocery store, go to bed at 11 pm. Etc.Do all of these things, and you should tell yourself you have had a succesful and productive day, and suceeded in improving your life. Neurotypical people to do not judge their own daily succes on grand scales a perfectionist usually does. It's been a good day if all you set out to do was achieved without too much of a hassle. And all a neurotypical person sets out to do is not changing the world, or finding the cure for cancer. In the case of an actual cancer scientist, a good day could be simply finally having started on growing a certain cel culture, or running a certain analysis. For many, making these daily goals comes natural and automatic to them, however, that's not the case with many people in recovery. This could very well be the balance you're looking for.  |||I know, that's the problem. But frankly, I do think gains like these are not sustainable for any kind of system, at least, when considering the long term. I mean, imagine a world in which this trend will continue without a crash in sight. It would threaten the world order in terms of wealth distribution way too much - both for current in power entities, as well as just for the average person - for Bitcoin to see mainstream adoption. It will crash. Maybe not to 1k, but hopefully back to maybe 3-6k or so, from which it can build up again, but in a more sustainable pace. |||With residency you'll be allowed to vote in local elections, just not national elections.

When I got together with my SO (I was 18, he was 23) I told him in no uncertain terms that there would be no talk of engagement or marriage before I finished my university studies at ~25-26ish exactly because of this reason.It's post like these that remind me why I've always been so stubborn about this issue.|||How self aware is she of her own emotions and processing procedures?When I'm really in deep shit, I usually am still able to communicate my needs in a calm rational manner before I break down.It took some time to learn, but now I tell my SO to the point: darling, I'm going to lock myself in the bedroom now. I need time, don't disturb me untill I come out myself sometime tonight, please make dinner.When we had a death in the family I didn't want to be approached by anyone. So I asked my SO directly to call his mum and explicitly ask her not to contact me because I knew she would. That's the type of practicality I think of before I go full shutdown.If she is similar, I think it's ok to ask her for the boundary conditions if she doesn't indicate them herself. How long do you think you might need, hours or days? Will you promise to contact me yourself once you're ready? Can I do practical thing  X to help? Etc. And then leave her alone and gold yourself to those agreements.When I'm in super intense emotional states, reaching out and asking me how I'm doing or hey you're amazing are really tough to process. It does not help. It would take me out of my process, make me feel obliged to answer and satisfy your emotional needs for answer, it would make me annoyed and would make me think 'why aren't my feelings important enough for him to do what I asked, why must I take care of his emotional needs all the time' even thouhg rationally I would know it's meant well.Also, after I'm done processing, I'm done. I don't want to linger on those emotions and talk about 'woe is me, I'm so sad'  because I'm not, that shit was processed and dealt with.

I think it's part of a UN initiative to reduce multiple nationalities. It's not only the Netherlands. Also, yes, taxes are high, but on par with many of the other western/northern EU countries. I get that Americans are bummed out by the taxes, but usually it's what the taxes provide that makes them want to come to Europe to begin with. Also, taxes in NL are tiered, so you only pay the highest bracket of taxes for the income *above* that threshold, not your whole salary.|||I love the shoes from the first pic, do you have a link to them? I'm looking for similar ones. I also looove the leggings, you really have some killer legs and the leggings make them look amazing. I like the second look less, tbh. I love the aline skirt (you should match them with those shoes from the first pic, the colours would look lovely!), but the top with the straps going toward your neck makes you look kinda round.I think that outfit would work better if the top would be fuller at the shoulders (or at least had the straps extend straight up from your chest). That would really push focus to your waists and balance the lines with that aline skirt.|||If you like her style, definitely check out the brand Miss Candyfloss!

Either way: your best bet is to get a masters degree in Europe. Easy visa, and with an engineering MSc, there's a big chance you'd easily transition into an engineering job in the EU. Do note though that most engineering master programmes in the EU are two years, not one. This also means two years of tuition. That's why I asked about nationality, as the Dutch tuition for non-EU students is typically 10-15k/year, opposed to 2k/year for EU students. |||Do you have similar red/pink bumbs on the rest of your body?

I actually had to laugh when I read the * note... Anyway, your physical copy: is it the original? Like the one you got during your graduation ceremony and everything? Not just some random transcript you downloaded off your school websites but the official original document? That should most likely be fine. (*Especially* if it has some kind of 'real' markings like a stamp or signature).Some background on why they ask for this: in NL, your original diploma is a single copy document. You get it once and once only. If you lose it somehow, you can still request a transcript / proof of diploma from your institution, but not a second copy of the official diploma itself. So either you'll need to hand them a copy of the original or you need to give them an official statement (issued by an authority within the institution, that's why stamp and signature are needed).|||Het is oprecht best een interessant onderwerp om je verder in te lezen. Wat mij dus opvalt is dat binnen dit framework wij op een aantal lagere niveau *geen* equivalent hebben in ons systeem, maar we dus op de hogere niveau eigenlijk *meer* onderscheid hebben dan andere landen. Wat zegt dat over ons onderwijs als land, is dan mijn gedachte...De reden waarom hogescholen uiteindelijk bachelordiplomas uit mogen keren is omdat ze gewoon te goed zijn om onder EQF niveau 5 te vallen (het niveau waar we nu eigenlijk niks hebben staan als Nederland), ondanks dat - laten we eerlijk zijn - een WO en HBO bachelor toch echt twee andere soorten diplomas zijn qua opleiding. |||Interesting collection of thoughts! I fully agree with you on your statement regarding needing both deep and superficial friendships/relationships. Both serve a function and are important. How much of each you need, fully depend on the person, but I doubt anyone can be truly fulfilled without either. Reading through your post, I did find a bunch of things that made me go 'I'm not so sure about that'. I'll quote some of these blurps and give my thoughts on them. There is a difference between sharing and bragging. From a relational perspective, it is *incredibly* useful for the other to know about details in your life you'd consider to be 'bragging'. That's how you build networks. Also, bragging - to me - is also closely linked to intention. If somebody has run a marathon and enthusiastically shares this feat with their friends, that's not bragging, that's sharing. The intention is about inclusion of these people in your life, about sharing joy.Here's a trick I do when getting to know people: *do* challenge their opinions, but do so while arguing from their value perspective. For example, I have many religious friends (I am very much atheist) and I had some very good discussions by discussing their opinions from *their* perspective. It's an awesome way to really get to know someone. Sharing negativity *can* be good for relationship building. Opening up about shit in your life can strengthen bonds, and even low key negativity has a place. Consider for example how important gossip is for social dynamics and cohesion. There definitely is a balance, but cutting out all the negativity is not necessarily doing you a favour (see also my points above about bragging vs. sharing). So very true.. I was having some drinks with friends I haven't seen in about 2 years or so. We were actually discussing this. The amount of 'high quality' people is rather low, but it's important to have them in your life. That being said, they *do* flock together just like the assholes do, it's just a matter of getting into those circles and making an effort to keep those circle alive and vibrant. In general, I believe in the mantra 'don't spend your energy on what you don't need in your life'. I don't even try to engage in building proper relationship with the asshole folk. Not worth my time and energy. So, this whole section doesn't resonate with me *at all*. I have a pretty keen intuition for fishing out the 'high quality' people and whenever I do, we usually hit off straight away with some very good and deep discussions from which we build our friendship. I don't remember birthdays, and my friends don't either. We really do not have the mental headspace to deal with those banalities. HOWEVER, the moment somebody is like 'hey, it's my birthday, shall we go to the pub together?' everybody makes a proper effort to clear their calendars. Honestly, I think it is a bit lazy and selfish to expect to be invite to a whole bunch of stuff if you don't put that kind of effort into the friendship yourself as well.I guessed you were bullied in your youth halfway through your post. The need for both validation but also the instinct to make yourself small because you don't want to be a bother is very typical for people like you. I see this in my SO as well. Here's the deal though: you don't need this validation. A proper 'true king' does not need to tell he is king, nor does he need people to revere him as king. He *knows* he is king and that knowledge is enough. Like you said, you need to be yourself, but you also need to be happy first and foremost in yourself that being yourself is enough. If this is not for you, don't bother (be yourself!). I tried this in my teen years at college.. and at one point I simply said; fuck. this. shit. I hate party environment, they give me absolutely no joy, and I'm not putting myself through that anymore. Also, you're not likely to find your kind of people if that place is simply not for you.Hope this gives you some food for thought! |||No, I don't think that's the case for men who have made *any* type of sexist joke. Frankly, I doubt there is a person who has *never* made a sexist joke, simply because these gender norms are so ingrained in society and it's quite easy and 'natural' to fall back in those patterns. I know I'm guilty as charged, because I definitely made jokes at the expense of both men and women, for the wrong reasons. The difference is, these men and women usually realize afterwards that their joke was inappropriate. There is however a sub group of men and women who make this a habit, and who somehow manage to get a sexist joke in during every laid back, social setting they find themselves, again, because deep down, they believe what they are saying and are looking for validation. That behaviour is not OK in my book. By the way: I really appreciate how you approach this discussion. You disagree with me, which is absolutely fine, yet you approach the subject very respectfully. Discussions on gender and sexism have a dark side to them if you have these discussions in a highly 'progressive' (note the air quotes) environment, as those environments tend to shut down any opposition or discussion quite harshly. Yet you took a potentially vulnerable position which left you open for a 'hurr durr, you're part of the patriarchy' attack, without resorting to those same tactics yourself. That's pretty damn awesome.  |||The last bullet point is so real. I think one of the major obstacles young students face is how to plan their work load. It can be overwhelming. The goals big, and typically somewhere far along in the future, you need to learn how to break down a goal into manageable tasks. I see soooo many students who have massive to do lists that say 'write paper for course x'.. that's not going to help you at all. One of the major things I learned in undergrad that kept me sane throughout the final legs of undergrad and grad studies is to plan my time. I plan a *maximum* of 5 to do points (but typically only 3) for the next day before I go to bed. This include things like 'write an introduction for paper x', 'read and summarize articles x,y,z' etc. Stuff I know is physically and mentally possible to finish that day, and then I make sure to commit to those handful of goals to that day. Also: when I do finish my goals for that day, I allows myself time off to relax and *have fun*. There's always tomorrow.|||I'm still a student (almost done, finally!) and racking up my loans, but I expect a (for European standards) ridiculously high debt of about 70k euros, with my long term SO having a similar debt. However, this is not a fair comparison to for example the US situation, as the burden caused by the debt is much less significant. I'm Dutch, and i take out governmental loans. (Translating freely now, so I hope I get it across correctly) the interest rate on the government issued student loans is directly tied to a a 5 year average interest on the Dutch governmental bonds, which currently is 0%. Also, payback is a maximum of 4% of your income above minimum wage, for a maximum of 35 years and any remaining balance will be paid by the government.So, why do I have such a high debt? I sadly didn't get *any* financial support from my parents and I made the very conscious decision to focus on my studies instead of spending time working at the local grocery store for minimum wage. I didn't waste money, but I did borrow enough to have a frugal yet comfortable life. Jobs I had during my studies I took on because they were relevant for me and my career, not for the money. Any money earned was put aside into savings and investments. This in the end will make me graduate with several (high demand) master degrees, a bunch of valuable extracurricular and additional skills relevant to my career.So what will happen later on? Starting salaries for students from my degree(s) of 3k pre-tax a month are not uncommon, which is a seriously high income in the Netherlands to begin with. At that income level, I'll be repaying my loan at a rate of ~100 euros a month. It really will not hurt me a lot, because me income will *still* be high. It might cause issues with getting a mortgage later in life, but I want to become a DINK globetrotting expat anyway, so buying a home is rather low on the list of priorities anyway. |||The Dutch high school system is weird: you essentially take an IQ test at 12 years old when finishing up primary school, and based on your score, you get entrance to one of 3 levels of high school education. Only the highest level (called preparatory academic education, top ~20% of children) gives you direct entry to university level education. This high school programme lasts 6 years and after the first three the kids have to make a choice between several specialization profiles, one of which is STEM. In the last three years, they focus mainly on profile specific courses. This means that for 6 years, these kids have education specifically geared towards a certain level of intelligence and designed to prepare you specifically for an academic education. Those last 2-3 years are essentially spent on getting *all* their courses to AP level, which is possible, because you're in a class with exclusively other intelligent kids who chose for a set of courses that fits their interest and talent. Also, the examinations you need to pass to get your diploma are under strict governmental quality control, meaning that all students that get their diploma have a guaranteed knowledge background. That's why they demand so many AP courses from US students, as well as such specific courses, and also why as long as you meet those requirements, you're allowed entry without having to do interviews etc etc. It's kinda egalitarian in philosophy as well: proof you can objectively meet the entry requirement, and you will be granted entry on those objective measurements of academic prowess only. The same goes for you: proof you can meet the objective requirement of 4 AP classes in those specific subjects, and you're in, regardless of GPA, interview skills, nationality, etc. The system both has good and bad sides to it. Regardless, it's good to know the background of why the system is as it is.|||But every PhD does (read: is expected to) put in hours and *hours* of additional time way past the hours stipulated in their contract.|||They can come back... *if* they agree to accept the Euro, be part of the Schengen area, and them not getting veto rights.|||I read your post on my phone and I got off my ass to grab my laptop to write you a comment.You are very much in the same situation I was in. Long term relationship with boyfriend fighting depression/anxiety, while being stressed by university stuff and simply needing time of for yourself (I am not kidding when I say I need 2-3 hours a day of total alone time just to feel comfortable, let alone relaxed).There's one difference between our guys, though. My guy had depression before we got together, for which he was treated by both psychologists and psychiatrists. When he noticed the depression and suicidal ideation returning, he got back in touch with the hospital who treated him before so he could start a new treatment plan. I have no interest to discuss my SO's treatment, because this is not about him, this is about how I (and you!) viewed this situation. I went with him the first couple of times he went to saw his therapist. At one point, his therapist turned to me (with my SO next to me) and straight out told me: \\\"you need to stop. It's not your job and not your responsibility to heal him. You are currently acting as his crutch. You are not helping him, only he can help himself.\\\"An she was right. Getting over a depression is DAMN HARD work and nobody can actually put in the work needed, except for the person suffering from depression. He probably knows this, deep down, and that's probably also why he doesn't want to see a therapist. He doesn't (want) to believe he can help himself, let alone wanting to believe that the only one that can help him is himself. But you are not helping him either by continuing being his crutch. Worse: you are not helping him *and* dragging yourself down with it. The amount of emotional labour required to do what you are doing is enormous, I know, I've been there... you must be exhausted beyond believe. It wouldn't surprise me if you told me that even on the days you have a really good sleep, you still wake up exhausted. Honestly, I would just tell your SO you simply aren't available between 9 am and 6 pm, except for emergencies. My SO knew he could call me at any time during the day if he for example was having a panic attack and needed a life line to reality, but outside of those events, I had to focus on studying and he respected that. If he needed general emotional support or someone to talk to, he could call his parents or friends. The thing is: even if he were willing to see a therapist and was working incredibly hard on his recovery right now, that still wouldn't mean he could unload all emotional burden on you and you alone. This is not being mean or selfish, because your behaviour towards him now is not doing either of you good.|||Just curious, but are you planning to apply for the University of Groningen after you get your certificate? What degree do you plan to apply for? I mean, I know the UoG does not offer electrical engineering, so I'm just curious why you chose electrical engineering at Hanze if your goal is to switch over to uni later.|||How long you'll have to wait until you can fire will depend on how much money you are saving of each pay check. If you want to retire in 4 to 5 years, you'll need to save about 80 to 85 percent of each paycheck. Saving 50 percent of your paycheck means retirement after 16 years. Google mister money matters, he has a really good blog post on this.Anyway, maybe this is not feasible on a 100k salary, but let's say 150k salary.. saving 80 percent gives you a yearly spending budget of 30k. Not a lot, but people at r/leanfire manage on those type of incomes. If you are willing to live on a 30k income the rest of your life, and have a high salary to save large amounts of your salary, you *could* retire in a few years.For most, this is not feasible. I think most of the stories you'll find here will be people retiring after 10-25 years after starting fire. The fire after 10 years are mostly singles, while the fire after 20 years are more likely to be families. It's not easy to fire, and the truth is, it is a long game, for all of us.|||Ask around if you can get a grade distribution breakdown for your degree program. This differs *a lot* between universities and degree programs! A *very* rough estimate: about 15% graduate cum laude (at my uni, GPA &gt; 8, nothing below 7, no resists) and maybe 2-5% graduate summa cum laude (GPA &gt; 9, nothing below 8, no resits). Obviously, summa cum laude is a *very* high standard. I know people who've done this, but these people were absolutely dedicated to their studies. In the Netherlands, much more emphasis is put on extra curricular activities (boards, councils, committees) and personal development (volunteering, travel, holding a job next to your studies) as a sign of excellence opposed to just grades. A student with cum laude and additional experiences will generally be ranked as more successful by companies compared to a student with summa cum laude and nothing else.If your goal is to transfer to a top tier uni for your masters (?), your personal profile will also matter next to your grades (which are also critical to getting accepted), as typically they are looking for well rounded people, not just people who get high grades. I would say, aim for cum laude, but not at the cost of everything else. I've known plenty of people who have GPA of 7 - 8 and did Honours to up their academic prestige a bit for example. What do you want to achieve with your degree? Maybe you can help organize a model UN conference, or volunteer in humanitarian aid relief efforts. Maybe you can do a research project for youe minor at a top uni already by using the connections of professors you'll meet over the years.Be conscious of what you want out of life and work to build your personal story around that goal. All the students I know who's goal was 'get into Harvard' (or similar) rarely got in, those for whom Harvard was part of reaching a bigger goal did typically make it.|||You need to make a list of all the essentials that need to be done, then go to your boss and ask him/her: please order these tasks hierarchically in order of importance. Then you tell him/her that there is too little capacity at the moment and you will be working your ass of during the 9-5, but it is not realistic to simply handle all essentials with the current capacity. You will focus on the order of importance the boss has given you, but you can only do so much in your time. Once the clock hits 5, sure, finish that one email you've been working on, but don't go on for hours.

Fine, that's not too long. What's your next step? Or, if you don't have a next step yet, what do you want your next step to be? What's required to be able to make that step? Are you lacking industry contacts in that specific field? Would your resume maybe benefit from an additional certificate or experience? If so, actively start working on those things, so you're ready to go and change your life for the better when those 6 months are up. The same with your relationship: what do you want (better: *need*) it to be? It's clearly not meeting those criteria right now. Here's the catch: you can only change your behaviour and actions, not those of anyone else. Is there anything *you* can do with regard to your relationship on a time frame that is reasonable to you that would make it up to your standards? If yes, great! Go ahead and start working on it! If not, you need to make plans to get out.|||Frankly, if you have a good (or even decent) relationship with your PI and your research is going well, I would simply play hardball and tell your PI: I tried to discuss my issues with you, but it went nowhere, starting next week I refuse to teach and guide this student, you'll need to find someone else, if you want, I have no problem taking on a new student or switching with one of my colleagues. As much as the power dimension between PhD student and PI is very asymmetric, you need to realize that the PI already spend a lot of research/grant money on you, which they won't be able to recoup if they want to get rid of you to find someone else. Your PI (especially if they are still younger, non tenured staff) depends a lot on you and your success for their own career progression as well. You hold quite a bit of power in that regard.|||I mean, we still pay for it.. insurance is 100-120 euros a month, and yearly deductible/co pay/whatever you want to call it is 400-500 a year. But compared to the US, this is absolute heaven in terms of access to medical care.|||This makes me think of a story my parents told me. My dad is a western Europen citizen and my mother was from another region. She got married with my dad and got her European citizenship as well. Years later, the war broke out in my mother's home region. They wanted to get moms family out of there, but the embassies had lines for days and were totally gridlocked and my mom's family got nowhere. My dad got on a plane (obviously against government advice), gathered up my mom's parents and brother, they got themselves to his embassy. He walked to the front of the line (remember, this region now counted as an active warzone) held up his passport and demanded entry for him and his family. They let him in straight away (because he had ultimate proof of being a citizen) and they arranged asylum for the family on the spot.If that's not a shit hits the fan situation.. I don't know what is. Get yourself that Canadian passport. Sure, you have a 'proof of citizenship certificate, but when is this dated? If it's older than maybe a few months, what's to say you haven't renounced your citizenship in the mean time and kept the document? That certificate is not *proof* of your citizenship (not a discussion you want to have on a SHTF situation), while a valid passport is.|||This sounds very typical for these kind of student org setups.. how about detaching the outreach function from the bigger org, make your society fully independent and collaborate with the bigger org when needed. I'm saying this because a 'network' function in itself is something extremely fleeting and because these networks usually consist of building loose connections (cause that's what networking is about), in long run (say 2-3 years from now) after the original founders leave, there usually is little commitment to keep it going. If you make it part of something that is more rooted in your local community (such as the awareness outreach stuff) that can provide a solid foundation for not only building loose network connection but also a strong local social circle, your society might have more chances of succeeding.Also, by detaching it from the larger org, I can almost guarantee you that loads of the 'problematic guys' that are now being a negative force will simply not re-join the separate society. These guys probably only joined because of their affiliation with the larger org and figured 'why not', instead of being actually active allies for gender equality.|||Yep. Als onderdeel van Bologna is er een 'European Qualifications Framework' opgesteld, met daarin niveaus die gaan van (voor ons) VMBO onderwijs tot en met het doctoraat. De descriptoren van de niveaus voor bachelor- en masteronderwijs maken niet het onderscheid tussen 'beroepsgercht/onderzoekgericht' maar gaat om diepgang van kennis en de autonomie waarmee een afgestuurde op dat niveau aan het werk gaat.

Zowel de HBO als WO masters zijn EQF niveau 7. |||Zoals anderen al genoemd hebben: dit is erg, *erg* lastig om te organiseren.

I think you are mistaken about that 28th birthday thing. The 28th birthday is only relevant if you have lived (legally) as a non-national in the Netherlands for a significant amount of time as a minor and want to gain Dutch citizenship after becoming a legal adult.Either way, for you it doesn't matter, because your dad was a Dutch citizen (whether he had a passport or not) at the moment of your birth and you can proof it. (I assume your parents were either legally married at your birth or your dad officially acknowledged you as his child.)You should contact your nearest Dutch embassy to see which documents they'd need to verify your citizenship. I guess they will simply request your grandfather's DUTCH birth certificates, copy of their naturalization certificate (and subsequent proof of renunciation of their Dutch citizenship?) or copy of their old dutch passport from when your dad was born, your dads birth certificate, and your own birth certificate. Those four documents should provide the chain of evidence you need to show that your grandfather was Dutch at the moment of your dad's birth (meaning dad is Dutch 'van rechtswege') which also means that you are. But again, just give the Dutch embassy a call. Should be relatively easy procedure provided you are able to get a hand on the documents, because - if your story is true - you don't have to apply for Dutch citizenship, because you already are one (and you're only applying for a passport).While you're at it, you could discuss with your dad whether he also wants to get his Dutch passport. He'll need roughly the same documents anyway...|||I'm saying having social equality =/= treating women as if they were men.And even if I wanted both men and women to be treated the exact same way, why should 'the male way of doing things' be the default?

I dont expect men to be pseudo women to be respected, the same way women shouldn't be expected to be pseudo men to be respected. That's bullshit.

That way there is no resentment and there will always be enough for everyone to go around. Each living to make the other happy (without fully sacrificing yourself in the proces, because you need to keep taking that what you need) results in a higher level of total, shared happiness from the perspective of the two of us as a unit, together.

Going through life as a unit, opposed to alone, made me stronger and more able to reach my goals. Most importantly: it makes me happy and provides me with joy, every single day.|||I definitely agree that women can be as sexist as men. That doesn't mean that simply because both men and women do it, sexism suddenly becomes ok or equality not worth fighting for.Nor does acknowledging that sexism towards women (which is the topic of this post) is damaging and unwanted, undermine the existence of sexism towards men. Nor does acknowledging the plight of women undermine the importance of men's rights and equaliry in topics such as mental health, suicide prevention, military draft, family law, reproductive rights, etc. Equality is not a zero sum game.|||If you ever consider emigrating to a new country, consider the Netherlands.

He would actually have made a fundamentally different decision.Yes, maybe victim mode is the wrong word to use. More like: drenched by a waterfall of emotions which renders him unable to think clearly, so it's just easier to sit tight, not move and hope everything passes (while internally convincing yourself you trying is futile anyway, so sitting tight is your only real choice - which I described with victim mode), than to actually try and outswim it.I don't want to go into much detail, as it's personal to him. But, in general terms: he was in a mental bad spot, got offered to opportunity of his life time, we set up everything so he could pursue that opportunity, and once the moment was there, it turned out his mental health was worse than we both expected it to be, when confronted with the additional strain of the realities of that opportunity, leading to a mental breakdown on his part. At that moment, we had about a day to decide how to continue. Wether he would continue and go forward with this opportunity (with me making some serious changes to my short term plans in life to stay close to him because he definitely couldn't stay on his own), or to abort the whole thing with him having to make short term alternative plans and change directions. He decided to abort the whole ordeal and forgo this once in a life time opportunity. After we got our immediate affairs in order (some weeks later), he signed himself up for therapy and started some intensive treatment plans to solve his mental issues. It took him over a year of constant battle with himself to get though his treatment plan, but he did, and although some parts of his mental issues will always stay part of him, he improved so, so much since he started therapy. He also since found a new path to pursue, leaving the path that opportunity would offer him behind him for good, but he is happy and in peace with that decision.|||Oh, yes, but I think it's inherent to your American political system isn't it?

You will make expensive mistakes along the way, buying stuff you think you'll love which won't end up working.Another tip from me. I know my weakness: I am NOT a morning person. Honestly, I can barely function in the morning. I have two wardrobes: one with all my clothes categorised, sorted and folded up, and another with 20 ready to wear and accessorized outfits of various ranges of formality, various colours and just different purposes (sometimes you just need a jeans and t-shirt,  better make sure it's perfect).Once every couple of weeks I spend an afternoon putting together outfits and trying new things (remember, editing is everything!). I check all my clothes on loose threads etc. and iron each outfit. This way, I save myself a lot of time, energy  and stress in the morning, as I can just pick any of my outfits and know the look is perfect. This gets me amazing day to day fashion  consistency I'm known for in my social circles, because even if I feel shit, I still end up with a good outfit.|||I was thinking more of a King Louie vibe opposed to Hell Bunny, tbh.Some examples:[1](https://www.kinglouie.eu/kl-davis-skirt-times-square-narrow-skirt-sunset-yellow), [2](https://www.kinglouie.eu/kl-border-skirt-rizzle-wide-skirt-alpine-green),[3](https://www.kinglouie.eu/kl-blouse-foxy-long-sleeve-black), [4](https://www.kinglouie.eu/kl-garbo-pants-denim-flared-ink-blue)|||Lots of love &lt;3 |||Dude... I looked at your picture and thought: ok, his acne is pretty bad, but that's something that can be dealt with, I wonder if he actually realizes what a handsome face he has. Then I saw many people already commented something similar so I figured never mind my comment, and just about when I was to leave your post, I saw this comment...Let me tell you this: I have several transgender friends, and although they pass now after finishing their treatment and surgeries, they (sadly) didn't when they were going through HRT... I read your comment and I'm totally gobsmacked. I looked at your pictures quite extensively before I read this comment and there was not a SINGLE MOMENT when I even doubted your gender. Your transition is absolutely incredible!|||That's exactly why I joined Cleopatra.|||Are you happy you quit hormonal birth control in the end? I'm thinking about the same, as I notice how much my BC is controlling my emotional state of mind (I'm mid 20s now). Maybe it would be better to quit hormonal birth control all together, though it scares the shit out of me.|||Thanks! I'll definitely take a more detailed look at some of these when I have some downtime. |||It's one of the universities close to the more metropolitan area. The 'big cities ' in the western part of the Netherlands have kind of grown big to the point their are all connected to each other. We call them de 'Randstad' to refer to the whole set of cities over there. These are cities like Amsterdam, Den Haag, etc.|||That's the point. In my country I *do* expect a 1.50 euro bar to be nice. Maybe not super amazing, but it definitely should be nice at that price point. The shit bars that taste like sugary shit here cost like 20-30 cents.|||The comments seem to all relate to Se experiences, either sports or arts.. I noticed both arouse some strong emotions in me. I absolutely hate physical excerise as I don't enjoy it *at all*, while I've also always felt frustrated by my lack of artistic creativity and intuition.You and /u/EMC2_trooper however discuss something different: the satisfaction of creating and building things. I think that's also what I would enjoy a lot.. it definitely gave me something to think about in the coming weeks.|||Assistant profs can still have their PhD (they even *need* to if they want to get promotion to associate professor), but generally, the full prof to the research group the assistant prof belongs to formally acts as promotor, even if the assistant prof is the actual supervisor of the student.|||My uni did a big ass internal analysis of the predictive value of all the stuff that is asked from prospective students when they enroll with regard to whether students graduate (on time). The question was: if we only want to admit students who we are pretty certain of they will graduate, based on what should we select them? (More a thought experiment than anything, as the laws in my country prohibit academic selection to a large extent.)The results were ridiculously conclusive. They found that there are exactly two metrics that showed significant correlation with degree completion. The first metric was highschool math GPA. This held true for *all* disciplines, even humanities and arts. The second metric was being female.Girls with a high math GPA were almost guaranteed to succeed, regardless of which degree they were pursuing, based on the last 10 years of data on student enrolment at our university.|||And this is when I'm reminded I'm not an English native speaker. I've been raised with the English language and I passed my CPE/C2 exam at 12 years old. I *can* read this passage with no struggle whatsoever, but the depth of it is lost. The words get read, opposed to being read (hmm, I'm not even sure if this sentence makes sense in *any* language...). If I would read something similar in my native language, the words are more internalized, I guess... the meaning of the different words all flow together, and the bigger picture just emerges on its own. If I want to read this English passage with the same intensity, I really need to take a seat, read the passage carefully and focus on experiencing the weight of each word. I just don't have that kind of patience.|||Which is exactly why I started this post with noting that I kinda expect an outright ban at one point for this post. I've been doubting whether to post about this topic for a few weeks now, but at one point I simply thought: well, either they ban me, or I will be leaving this sub on my own if things don't change. In that case, the net result would be the same, so better to address it head on and maybe there's a chance things will improve.|||Is it *really* that much easier and quicker compared to ironing? Does it actually work, especially on more difficult items like business blouses? I hate ironing, but I'm also hesitant on spending a bunch on a steamer if it's only a marginal improvement.|||Nice! I definitely understand you on this one. Definitely wouldn't mind if this spacing was commercially available. |||It wasn't even passive aggressive... reading that answer (I'm female by the way) in a vacuum I just read it as 'really it doesn't matter if you come or not, my moms here anyway so it's fine, but if you decide to go home, please do this chore for me before I get home'.|||Yeah, I can imagine US corps pushing the numbers up a bit, though I do wonder whether they make a difference for US expats moving from the US to NL (especially on temp assignments), versus EU natives. Though I'm not sure how the Dutch tax law works in detail. Obviously, US citizens who will come over for just a few years typically also *need* a higher salary considering they often have higher student loans and don't have govermentally regulated pensions like the Dutch do (so they'll need to save money on their own).This is also a major differences when it comes to FIREing in the Netherlands. If you go to the regular FIRE sub (with mostly americans) you see FIRE numbers of several millions of dollars. Many people on this sub have FIRE numbers of maybe 500-600k (and a paid off house), due to receiving a pension once they hit retirement age (and lower costs: healthcare, insurance etc.)|||I always get confused by these ratios and what they seem to represent (be it waist to height or waist to hip). When I got to an obese BMI range of 31-32, I decided enough is enough and I needed to slim down again. But at that BMI level, my waist to height ratio was .49 sharp, so apparently on the overweight threshold? I'm now at a BMI of 29, and my ratio is .48, back into healthy ranges apparently... yeah, I don't think so.|||At one point, if you want to excel in an academic field, hard work alone is not enough and you do need some talent and intuition for the field. Talent without hard work only gets you so far, but the same hold the other way around. I know it's an unpopular opinion, but yeah.. I think you should consider switching. Don't think of it as losing or anything, the insights and skills you gained in this physics program are incredibly valuable and carry over to many other fields. Hell, I know a law student who took a gap year to take physics courses to train her analytical thinking skills.|||Why does success (whatever this may be and mean) make you worth anything at all? What defines a person's worth and value?|||Awesome! Now that's you've done it once successfully the next time will be soooo  much easier and less stressful! Great job.|||I guess I lucked out. I met my guy when I was 18 (he was 23) and we were both students. I told him straight away I won't get married untill we'reboth done studying and have stable jobs. He just started his career, I'm finishing up my masters so it will still take a couple of years before we get married. By that time, we've spend close to a decade together through our early adult formative years and been through major life changes. Any success in our life, we build together from the very start and I *know* I know this man to the very core of his being, so I have no hesitation whatsoever about taking on the potential risks of marriage.|||Well, based on what you wrote, definitely not Amsterdam. Delft is nice, but.. it is close to the big cities, so it feels more massive in my opinion. Eindhoven and Groningen are more isolated, which also means that their are much more 'student cities'. I myself study at Groningen. It's pretty amazing. A quarter of the people in the city are students, so the city revolves around student life. It's still very much a city, but it's rather small and cozy. Also, one thing I really like (which you won't get at Eindhoven or the TUs) is the comprehensiveness of the University. RUG is actually the only traditional Dutch university that offers engineering degrees. Because of this, you make friends with backgrounds in all kinds of different fields. |||I'm early-mid twenties and was thinking about the same thing (similar stock distribution as well). Frankly, I came to the conclusion that whatever happens, it really doesn't matter if my time horizon is several decades... and if a serious crash happens that will ruin the world for decades to come, I will have other worries than the money I put into stocks.If you are expecting a crash within the next years, there are far more useful things to focus on: make sure you have the education, skills and experience necessary to make yourself employable even during a crash. Both my parents lost their jobs mid-career during the 2009 crash. They careers of choice made them very much employable before 2009, but during the crisis, their positions were not necessities to their companies (or the economy in general). They lost their jobs and due to their age, they really never got back on their feet after and never got back on the track they were on before, even after the economy recovered. If you're worried about the consequences of a crash on your future wealth, it would be this, not the behaviour of your stocks during the crash itself. |||Well.. because it was *fun*. So much fun. I'm all grown up now. And I most definitely want to go back some time with my SO to go on all the rides once more, and yes, eat the crappy overpriced food and run after each other like little children while throwing that overpriced popcorn at each other. Actually act like the grown up children we are in public. Seriously, you actually got me excited now!In the end.. I guess, it doesn't matter how much money you have in your account, if you haven't had some intense fun and enjoyment along the way (whatever fun and enjoyment might mean for you).And having done the castle thing.. no. If I would be given the choice, I'd rather see Disneyland again once more. I mean, castles are nice, but I live in medieval city, and 'fresh local food' is my daily staple to begin with. It's simply not as 'magical' as Disney is.|||So, for housing, it's not like you have a centralized one-party housing system. SSH has a bunch of buildings of varying ages, state of maintenance and overall quality, and the ones you find on FB are likely just houses owned by individuals (although there are a couple of families with a big share on the Groningen property market..) who rent rooms. As you can imagine, quality in this case also varies *a lot*.If you are only staying for 6 months, I highly recommend just getting something through SSH if you're able, as it would simply save you a lot of hassle...For bikes: check out swapfiets.nl which is a bike rental service for students. Although it's also super easy to find a cheap bike in one of the many bike stores.. but again, with 6 months, this might save you the hassle and won't be much more expensive than actually buying a bike.Public transport in Groningen is amazing. You order a public transport card online, which gets delivered to you (just do this the first week you get here), and you can charge it with money. Usually supermarkets have machines where you can charge your card. You just tap your card when you enter and leave the bus, and money gets taken of your card as you travel. Not sure where you're from, but make sure you bring a debit card as well, not just a credit card. Dutch society is build on debit card usage and you might find that paying basic stuff like beers at smaller cafe's or your groceries are not always as easy to pay with credit card as might be the norm in your country.|||Just one thing: just because a kid doesn't remember things, doesn't mean there is no profound influence from experiencing these things with regard to their development. Sure, maybe Disney isn't worth it, but experiences like international travel trips that may be expensive, and may not lead to any memories, can very well have a big impact, even at a young age. Exposing the kid to new sounds, new tastes, new visual inputs, having them try out basic phrases in a foreign language, etc all stimulate them in their development. I may be a bit biased, though. My earliest memories of when I was 3-4-5 years old are all from travels I did at that age. Silly things like the smell of jasmine flowers from when we had a family holiday to Tunisia. Or how my dad taught me to say 'je voudrais un coca' in a Parisian cafe to the waiter. I distinctly remember a sense of nervousness followed by the pride I felt from being understood. Apparently, the impact of those trips was pretty big. I can only imagine what the other effects on my tiny brain were back then.|||There are some notable exceptions though. Take industrial engineering and management at Groningen. The Groningen programme is an actual engineering degree and the big multinations recognize it as such. They hire IEM students from Groningen for engineering positions along side chemical, mechanical, etc engineers, but not from the technical universities (where IEM has a much stronger focus on management opposed to engineering). Although I do think you're right, I don't think it will be much of an issue for CS students considering the serious demand for them.|||Lets see.. Sleep in until 11 or 12 am, gaming on my playstation, watching YouTube, practise coding, going out bar hopping with friends, clothes shopping, practising my makeup skills, but also, if I was doing a course which I really really enjoyed and *wanted* to work on an assignment for, sure, why not? As long as it was something I wanted and enjoyed doing that moment. |||I'm curious, what kind of abusive scenarios are you thinking off when considering this specific dynamic?|||The difference between doctor and professors in TT situations in Europe is typically quite easy: a professor has ius promovendi, a doctor does not. Ius promovendi is the right to be someones primary promotor, granting the PhD their doctors title after their defence. An assistant professors in the Netherlands (first step of TT) typically is only addressed by dr. while associate and full professors are typically addressed with prof. dr.|||To get into any European master degree, you need a bachelor degree in the same field. If you are thinking about doing your graduates degree in law on this side of the ocean, make sure you have a law bachelors degree instead.|||Don't take this the wrong way, but reading your comments, it seems you don't live in a highly developed, super prosperous region (on top of not having higher education diplomas?). The thing with finding careers in humanities, especially in niches, is that these do require an economy that accommodates for jobs like these. I understand your interest and wish (many people in my family live in developing countries), but you might have more luck getting the skills needed to have a solid job with good pay, and use the money to finance personal projects related to your history niche and do something you really like to do, instead of finding some way to barely make a living out of history itself.|||Allow yourself to and don't be afraid to make wrong choices. Wrong choices are not mistakes. They are choices made which seemed best at the time when you made them, but didn't turn out to be the right choice in the end. That's ok. It happens. Be it with your selection of potential SOs, your degree, your career...Also: allow yourself to and don't be afraid to change the path you choice once you realize you made the wrong choices.Wrong choices are never wasted time or effort. They allowed you to learn more about the world and yourself, which granted you the insight to realize the choice was wrong. That's valuable!Most of all: when faced with the next choice to make, look at the options that make you *slightly* uncomfortable. Feelings like 'im not sure I really good enough' or 'this might be tough and difficult' or 'im not ready for this' will be your guide. Progress and succes follow from pushing yourself. By limiting yourself to choices which you'll know are 100 percent doable and achievable, you'll never get most out of your life.And again, if in the end it turned out to was wrong choice and you're indeed not good enough: that's ok! That's not failure, that's learning and development! Re-evaluate your options and try something else instead.|||Post like yours are so important. When I was a teenager, I was really curious about the bdsm scene. Now that I'm older, there are definitely bdsm aspects to my sex life, though I'm not part of the scene. However, the scene has had a profound influence on me growing up. It was post like yours, people like you, and discussions like these that instilled a clear sense of self-respect, boundaries and expectations regarding my (sexual) intimacy. The openness with which people in the scene would be willing to answer questions and simply talk to me about my thoughts and worries made a big difference. I grew up to be really confident and secure in myself, because people like you were so outspoken about these things when I was an insecure teenager.  Whatever people might think about bdsm acts themselves, the people in the bdsm scene are amazing role models for everyone. I know that there are thousands of others like me as well. Just wanted to let you know: the time you put into writing these posts and putting yourself out there.. it *does* make a difference, to someone, somewhere. Please don't ever stop.|||This is the reason why in the EU a sunscreen can only go to SPF 50. Anything above is SPF 50+. There is no valid scientific way to truly differentiate and confirm SPF at such high levels, so the EU was like: nope, consumer misleading labels are not allowed.|||Can't imagine that to be the case when the product is European (as mine was). The EU is quite stringent on ingredient reporting. It also has the International Aloe Science Council certificate logo on the packaging, if that means anything. |||Where are you from? If it's a handwritten exam, be sure to write out all steps and show your thinking process (write it down!). The Dutch educational system typically values the process more than the final result. With many of these math tests: you could have every final answer wrong due (faulty calculator input for example) and still pass the exam if your process if mostly correct. I'm an engineering student for example. If my answers is wrong, but I'm able to recognize my mistake and write down I realize my answer is wrong with an indication of where I might have made a mistake, I would still gain *a lot* of points on that question. Depending on where you're from, this might be a very different philosophy compared to what you're used to.|||I can also imagine that the same people who like wind surfing will probably also enjoy other types of surfing as well. If you get involved with that association, big chance you'll make friends that enjoy wave-surfing, and also big change you'll also enjoy wind surfing (but maybe not as much as wave surfing) enough to make it worth while your time. I've seen people do some crazy stunts on their wind surfboards on the north sea with pretty extreme winds. That shit was CRAZY. Absolutely, stunningly amazing, but crazy.|||My dad was always really worried about me, because I never invited friends over. Even now in my mid 20s, I still don't really enjoy having people over. I always did have friends though. I'm still - in my experience - very close to my high school friends even though we don't see each other a lot. I am very introverted and don't crave close connections as much as other people, but I feel happy and content about the number and depth of friendships in my life, and that's all that counts.In my country, you do an IQ test at 12, and only the top 15% get to go to the type of high school that grants entry to university. Some schools have mixed level education, but I consciously decided to go to a high school that only offered this highest level education. This was an absolutely blessing, as I got the intellectual challenge I needed and I was able to make a bunch of friends who I shared my intellectual passions with. I can imagine you will start making more friends when you get to uni, provided you're open to it and actively opt in for activities etc. (Life is about actively opting in, not opting out.)Anyway, life at your age is confusion. Just.. hold on and hang tight. Try to get yourself in a mindset of being open for new experiences and just try a whole bunch of activities. Not liking it is just a valid a conclusion as liking the experience. Thinking you *might* not like it should not be a reason to not at least try.Continue having big dreams. You might be the only one who actually believes in them, but that's ok. Dream big, because your instinct is telling you you can make it, don't overshadow that instinct by believing the people with no dreams at all when they tell you what you want is impossible. Your dreams WILL change over the next years (and even many, many years after) and that is OKAY! Don't be afraid to bin a dream and start a new one.Also, cry, be angry, be annoyed, all of that emotion is normal and healthy. Don't bottle it up and banish it to a dark corner, try to actually *feel* and understand your emotion. It's scary, but it will pay off big time later in your life if you start learning how to work *with* your emotions now, instead of fighting against it.|||Is it really that difficult to get a firearm in the UK? In my continental EU country it really isn't that hard, although gun ownership among the population is minimal. The only requirement is that you've been a member of an officially recognized sport rifling association/club for at least a year (who aren't allowed admit you without a background check), to get a permit from your local precinct (who will check your membership, and again, background check). You need to register each weapon at the precinct including where the weapons will be stored, which needs to be a certified weapons locker at your home (ammo and weapons in different lockers). Police might do random house visits to check whether your weapons are indeed at your home and stored properly once every couple of years.Sure, that's more restrictive compared to the US, but not really *hard* to get your hands on a firearm is you really want to.|||**BREAKING NEWS**: Congratulations, you're sexist!|||Really? I actually find the mods super responsive. If I report a post for rule breaking  it's usually removed from the sub within a couple of hours.|||Oh, yes. That definitely sounds familiar. I'm ENTJ, my SO in INTP. One of the reasons why our relationship is working out so incredibly well is because he recognizes my need for these 'in the zone moments'. Especially when it's a critical 'in the zone moment' regarding major deadlines etc., I can go to him and tell him: I need my time and focus to finish this, I expect it will take about this much time daily over the course of the next days/weeks. And when I get in the zone, he gives me space - more even - he accommodates me as much as I can in terms of taking care of household duties etc. and not bothering me with anything that can wait for some other time. If during these times I'm losing touch with our relationship and my SO feels he needs more time/love/energy from me, he will very openly tell me: \\\"you're working a lot right now, I would like you to schedule this amount of time for me on a daily basis and this weekend, I would like you to take the afternoon and evening off so we can spend some time together, can you make that happen?\\\" His trick is to always start this discussion when I'm having some 'down time', for example, during dinner, never when I'm in the heat of my focus. He is also very clear about his needs. It's never: 'I never see you anymore, you need to make time for me.', but rather 'I would like to have daily dinner together and at least 30 mins after dinner to catch up on our days' or 'I would like you to plan time in the next few days so we can go see a movie together'. Considering he does his best to accommodate me and my needs, I always take these requests seriously and make sure I can accommodate his needs as well. |||Be careful with this advice. Especially in most of Europe, having only a university bachelor degree is nearly useless and you *need* a master to be competitive in the job market. There are *some* exceptions (CS comes to mind), but in general, this hold true. |||A numerus fixus (what you're describing) is granted directly by the ministry of education, requires a 2 year application process before getting it, and is only granted under *very* specific circumstances because this essentially deals with an exception to the regular law (which  also states the ministry can make these very specific exceptions). Getting a fixus is *not* an easy process and is definitely *not* the default. |||I agree. Frankly, I truly belief in a fixed number of spots per year per degree program, ranking all applications and only admitting the best. The government should make that possible by changing the law. Not only would it fix the housing problems, it would greatly improve educational quality as well.. But of course, that's easy for me to say, as I'm white, with highly educated parents, and grew up upper middle class. Access to education is not an issue for my demographic, but my approach would without a doubt slash the number of students from poorer, less educated social classes entering university. |||This right here is the problem. Healthcare is *not* a fucking retail product. Yet, in the USA it's treated as such, resulting in people not being able to get basic medical care.|||Are you a student? If so you might be interested in the RUG/Hanze collab on their Centre for Entrepreneurship. They organize exactly these type of activities throughout the year.|||wow.. this is awful. And all of it right now is very, *very* raw. I can understand wanting to act right *now*, but also feeling like it isn't your place to tell. What you wrote here is actually amazing: You are right about going up to here and saying 'Hey sis, *I* don't think you're ugly!'. That would be so, so painful right now and totally not have the effect you're hoping it will have. If you want something you can do today, how about writing her a letter (maybe even handwritten!) about how you noticed she is sad, and you're writing her to let her know about how amazing she is and what she means to you. Don't say anything about the vote or make it about her physique, make it about *her*. Let her know you're there for her and that she's more than welcome to talk if she wants to. Write down all the dorky stuff you can think of, really, it it's just your 15 year old brain telling you it's stupid, but it *isn't*! You can leave the letter somewhere in her room and slide it under her door. You don't have to have a conversation right away: like I said, it might be too raw at the moment. But a letter might make her feel a bit better right now.Whether you tell your parents: you don't have to decide today. Maybe, with a bit more time, you can get your sis to open up and convince her to tell your parents herself.|||Just so you know, but I feel that the Dutch more than other societies is still very much a networking society. Most jobs aren't advertised, only those related to public institutions and those of private companies when there is a serious clear cut need for the position... you just start talking through people in your network and find out whether some departments have some spare money for good people, and usually get a job that way as a more senior, higher educated professional.Hit up some recruiters on LinkedIn I'd say...|||I'm finishing up my supply chain management masters degree at the moment. Mind telling me some more about the company you work at and what you think of the company culture etc? Could also be through PM if you're not comfortable disclosing it publicly.. I want to work for a big company and I'm currently making lists of potential employers I would like to work for. Would love to hear more about your employer and whether you'd recommend them. |||This is a problem of *him* being shit about communicating his emotions. *He* is having a problem with *you* so it is up to *him* to address his problem, not you.Anyway, it's easy for an ENTJ to just push annoyances or other 'non-major' feelings to the side and just continue on without giving them proper recognition. We might think we're not impacted by them, but we are and we don't acknowledge it. Meaning if you call us out on it, we wouldn't really see it as an 'us' problem (even though it is) but as a 'you' problem.For me, getting over this was simply a process of learning how to talk about my emotions, because it meant I actually had to listen to them and try to understand it. When my SO (INTP) and I got into a more serious phase of our relationship, we would have a night time ritual that really helped me (and him) develop these skills. Every night, we would take a moment to drink a cup of tea outside on the balcony before bed. No electronics, no nothing, just the two of us and a cup of tea. During this time, we would discuss what happened *that day* in terms of minor and major grievances etc either between the two of us or at work or whatever. We approached this moment as 'speak up now, or be at peace with your issue forevermore and don't you dare bother the other about it in the future'. Sometimes we would have nothing to tell, and we would just drink our tea is silence and go to bed. Sometimes, we would stay outside for 2 hours because there were big issues. On a typical day though, this ritual would only take about 20 minutes or so, but over time, these dedicated 20 minutes a day really started to add up. It was tough at first, but we really learned how to express ourselves and express what we needed from each other with some amazing precision. We've now been together for 6 years and we don't do this ritual anymore, because it's become such an integral part of our relationship to address anything that might bother us straight away and resolve it straight away. I have plenty of low key drama and passive-aggressiveness in my life, but my relationship ain't part of it. |||By the way, like the other user said: getting a Hanze degree + an additional 'bridge year' will also get you entry into a WO masters degree. If you decide to go the Hanze route, and you end up liking Groningen and want to stay here, you could decide to go that route as well, as the University of Groningen will soon start offering a WO MSc in Mechanical Engineering as well (but not a BSc). |||Thank you for this list, I saved your post, as I've been looking for something similar. How often do you update/back up your data?|||Note that if you want to do your masters abroad (because as always, education is the easiest way into a new country) you should carefully consider what you are majoring in for your bachelor degree. In most countries, you need a matching bachelor degree to gain entry into a master. Also, in that same view, if you want to get into another country to become a doctor, you'd be limited by CAN/UK/AUS/NZ, due to language requirements. Med school might not be the way to go if you want an easy way out of the country.|||Nice recommendation. You know what.. I'll have a listen at one of his podcast tonight. You tell me which one had a big impact on you and you would like to share with the world.

To the ENTJ, how all agendas go together makes *so much sense*, but only a few others know our agendas. If they do, they may know some of the bigger ones, but don't necessarily know all of them, nor how they go together.|||*Thank you.* Seriously, the whole parasitic relationship between baby and mother is one of the reasons why I - as a woman - do not want children. It freaks *me* the fuck out, but my opinion doesn't mean shit when it comes to women's agency of their own body, *especially* considering that extended breastfeeding has shown time and again to have health benefits regarding the child's growth and immune system. Women shouldn't be chastised for using their body for what it was literally made to do. There is nothing creepy about women feeding their child up to 2 of even 3 years of age. The thing that *really* creepy is society's obsession with the female anatomy and why this is somehow gross, inappropriate, or weird. |||AA programmes are not recognized in the EU at all, so this really is not good advice for people who want to get to Europe. You can't 'just' apply to a university in Europe either, you will need 4-5 AP courses to qualify straight out of high school, for STEM you often need those AP courses to be in related fields (maths, physics, etc). Entry requirements are pretty high, as university in Europe is definitely not the same as college in the US. We have a tiered system of higher education, if you want AA/College level education, you'd go to dedicated vocational schools, which, also, are usually not degrees that will give you any chance for a work visa after you're done with them, as they are not considered 'highly educated' and 'in demand'. |||This sounds more like an EDC than a BOB, no?|||For your character, consider this: to an ENTJ  everything, every action has purpose. Going out with co-workers serves a purpose, even spur of the moment comments which come up naturally, serve a purpose. An ENTJ can be super bubbly and chatty and extravagant and *act* and present themselves like.. I don't know, ESFJ for example, if it serves their purpose. That purpose is effectively the sometimes hidden, sometimes not very hidden agenda (or more likely: agendas) of goals which the ENTJ has spent significant time contemplating about (which to many is a very private process, through their Ni).I think it will be important to have a very clear idea of *why* your ENTJ does what he does, as this may not be directly apparent from an ENTJs behaviour on first glance.Only with their closest friends will agendas fade away and the interaction be more genuine (at least, that's what I imagine and F type to interpret it). This is where you're more likely to see the more emotional sides of ENTJs, which *can* run very deep and be a very profound part of an ENTJs life if the ENTJ values this and has spent time developing their emotional side in the past.I don't think any ENTJ would ever base their agendas on emotions, but in more developed ENTJs, the agendas will definitely have gone through some kind of emotional judgement filter and may be adapted somewhat based on the emotional needs of ENTJs. |||Interviews are not typically part of the process, but whether you get accepted or not will depend very much on the answer of those questions (also mostly in that order). |||I mean, I'm a 'gamer girl' (I guess woman by now) and my guy is also a gamer, but that doesnt mean we game *together* considering we like totally different games. Obviously, the issue you have with your girl is about spending not quality time together and you not focussing enough on her because you chose to game. That can still happen even if you find someone who likes gaming.|||Maybe a really stupid suggestion, but if it simply is a size issue (but you are happy with your system), why not just get a B6 notebook?

Having DST during the winter will be disastrous to many people's health.|||What my SO and I do (he's INTP) is to make it a habit of having conversations about how we feel and experience emotions from a very conceptual or mechanistic perspective.. both us being rather.. out of touch with our emotions, this helps us getting to know how to help each other best when we are not able to articulate it properly. We also always evaluate intense moments after it has passed. It helped us a lot.My SO also understands needing alone time, as he also needs it, although not as often as me actually... so we are able to just call it 'I need alone time' and be done with it.. I can image it being more difficult to convey to a partner that doesn't really experience that need (or is the opposite, like you are). I know that my more extraverted friends would think I'm becoming depressed or that something might be seriously wrong with me if I would withdraw myself and tell them to leave me the fuck alone and not contact me at all for an x amount of time, to which their solution would be to try and get me outside and active. I wouldn't want to deal with that shit at that moment, so deflecting is easier.Her needs might be different than mine despite being ENTJ.. keep that in mind. And getting to really know her and her emotional processes is something that might take years. Don't stress it too much, just try to be aware that she has different needs compared to you.|||As a woman who is shit at make-up but trying... What did this girl do that made her face look flat?

He had the same worries you had, considering we met literally the first week of me starting at uni. It never was an issue, I seriously don't ever think about it, nor does he, and the moments we comment on it are 'I can't believe we have such a large age gap, it doesn't feel that way at all'. Our relationship is incredible strong and healthy 5+ years later. A match in personality and COMMUNICATION style is more important than age. Only you can judge this, but if he is emotionally mature enough to communicate needs, feelings, and worries properly, the age gap will be barely noticeable. The point is: if he is emotionally mature, you won't be able to take advantage of him, because he will not stand for it and communicate to you from the very beginning if he is not happy about something. You do need to discuss your timeline though. That's something only he can decide and. For me, I would not want to start a relationship if I knew the relationship had an expiry date due to incompatible timelines because I don't want to face the heart break, others are willing to go into the relationship regardless, because the temporary love is worth the heart break. This is also a part of emotional maturity and knowing where you stand as a person.|||Happy to know life worked out for you in the end, obviously you deserve a break after everything you went through.

I have a similar weight distribution as Ashley Graham, and quite frankly, I love how my body looks. I got close to a BMI of 32 following weight gain after surgeries etc. and decided I needed to lose some again. The thing is, my goal weight puts me at a BMI of 25-26, which would still make me overweight.. I'm just not sure I want to lose more because I'm afraid I'll actually won't have the body shape I love when I do. Not sure how I feel about it health wise though, it's very conflicting.

I recommend trying it out for a full year, instead of single semester before you decide to do both or not. But you do need a strategy...The first year is tough: you need to pass the 45 credits for either of the two, and the first year is still very much guided. In Dutch I would call it 'handje vasthouden', which translates to holding your hand. Loads of intermittent exams, loads of mandatory lectures, just a whole bunch of extra lectures and information sessions on everything and everyone... It's just.. a lot. This is to make sure the average student has an easy transition from high school to uni life, but this hinders student like us who really don't need this and just want their freedom to study how they want, when they want. My advice is: pick one of the two, and *really* focus on that one and get all first year credits. For the first year, just pick one course extra each block of the second degree and just try it. If the work load gets too much, you drop the course of the second degree, or just try to do it with any spare time, provided you make sure you focus sufficiently on the first degree to make sure you pass all the courses of this degree. Make it a point to at least *try* each block to add that extra course, even if you failed completing the extra course in the previous block. Maybe at the end of the year you got another 20 credits (my uni has a 4 block/year schedule), maybe you only got 5, or 10 credits, or maybe non at all. Carefully evaluate what went well and what not, and decide if you want to continue with both over summer.I think I only got like 10 credits extra in my first year, but after carefully thinking it through I decided I could get way more once the mandatory stuff would go away in the second year.. and I was right, as in the second year I got an extra 35 (!) credits on top of try normal study load.I do want to warn you for one thing though: doing two degrees usually will cost you an extra year. You might be able to do it with half a year extra, but with all kinds of scheduling issues you're bound to encounter, an extra year is more realistic. I've worked with some of the country's most intelligent students who did double degrees (not even exaggerating) and even they were no able to do both in 3 years, not because of lack of intelligence, but because of logistics. Keep this in mind (also regarding costs as an international student).|||This is exactly why I mentioned it, because it's quite the opposite: *not* getting in tune with your emotions will in your future give you great difficulties in reaching your goals. The thing is, nothing is purely rational. Your desire to have close relations with people, your dreams and ambitions, your needs in life... all of those things have a strong emotional foundation interlinking all of those things, and boiling down to the question 'who I am in this life' which you are not *yet* aware of. Which is normal for a teenager. But ENTJs have a nasty habit of ignoring this aspect of their self all together, because it is hard and distracting with no clear benefit to it. The world is easier without all those pesky emotions, so let's ignore them and focus on the facts. Much easier, much more clear. That's how you end up in a quarter life crises not knowing who you are, what you *really* want from life, and what your values are. That's one damn hard crash and burn, which can be avoided by consciously starting to work on your emotions from your teenage years onward, despite this being hard work and time/energy consuming. Other types seem to do this intuitively, for us, not so much. |||Let me turn this question around: what kind of proof would you need?I mean, I could link to various studies, but if you don't recognize the status of social sciences, I'm not sure if that would help. I can link you  to a whole bunch of different discussions on reddit or anywhere else with hundreds upon hundreds of women corroborating these issues, but I guess that's no definitive proof either. Experiencing sexism is not a hard science, you can't run an isolated lab experiment to see whether the effects are universal. If that's what you are expecting, no one can convince you, but you'll still be left behind with a large population of women for whom this is their reality. Not being able to *proof* something is universally shared, doesn't mean it's not true, and it doesn't mean it's not a problem.|||haha.

I'm planning to get fully first aid certified in the coming months, which includes signing up for my neighborhood CPR watch. My country has a network of CPR qualified individuals who emergency services can call once they are alerted about a nearby cardiac arrest case.

I'll ask my trainers about this once I get around to the training.|||Same here. My parents had two very different approaches after they divorced. My mother was an emotional mess who would bad mouth my father any opportunity she got, while my father would simply refuse to tell me anything bad about my mother (despite him likely fuming with anger inside). Even when I asked him directly, the most he would say was 'I have my opinions about your mother, but they don't matter because she is still your mother and that's more important'. This came from a man who's ex accused him of everything under the sun, ruined his relationships with most of his family members because of it, and ruined him financially through court. A man who's lawyer once said 'if you are willing to put your daughter on the stand to speak out against her mother, I can make a very good case to have most of the damage reversed', which he outright refused because he, under no circumstance, no matter the personal cost, would put such burden on me (I only learned about this years later, honestly, I wish he did ask me to help me, but it was not my decision to make, because he was the parent and I was the kid).The relationship between my mother and I got real bad over my teenage years, because of her shit. She is still in my life (which 10 years ago I did not think would be the case) and I see her occasionally, but I simply can't get myself to say 'I love you' to my mother anymore, because I don't and she did too much emotional damage to me. Imagine only having one child and not hearing your child say 'I love you' for as long as you can remember... The relationship between my dad and I - even though he got to deal with  95% of my teenage drama over the divorce because he was 'stable' and my mom wasn't - is thriving.|||Agree, agree, and agree.

Niet dat je in dezelfde stad moet blijven en nu al die keuze moet maken, maar elke bachelor biologie heeft hoogstwaarschijnlijk dezelfde basis en de extra 'flavour' in de bachelor die verschilt van instelling tot instelling zal samenhangen met onderzoeksspecialisatie van die instelling. Vaak kun je dit makkelijker terugzien in het aanbod van masters dan in het curriculum van de bachelor.

Dit zijn dan toevallig ook specialisaties in de masteropleidingen.|||This right here is where you're fucking up. Why are YOU embarrassed for something SHE said? You realize that this emotional response is why she's doing what she's doing right? She sees how this affects you and it's exactly her intention to make you feel like this.

Men (and women by the way, many women are just as awful - and sometimes even worse - at making 'jokes' at the expense of men, don't get me started on that topic...) who 'joke' about women do not do so because they simply enjoy dark humor, but they do so because they deep down actually believe what they are saying, and are looking for support from peers to validate those feelings. To these men, these 'jokes' only serve one purpose: to make them feel better by putting women down and treat them as objects - something less than a human being like they are, because if they are an object, they are not to be respected and you don't have to feel threatened by them. If you as a man say you make the worst sexist jokes ever, purely because you enjoy dark humor, but are in all other ways a man who supports equality and does his utmost best to not be biased against women, seriously, if you ever visit my city, I'll treat you to some beers together, because I'd love to hear your jokes and I'd probably be laughing the loudest. The point is, I also hope you realize this is not the case for *most* men who make these jokes. And that's why these are not jokes. And that's why they are harmful. Like you said: it's fun because you know its wrong. But what if the person making the joke doesn't actually think it's wrong? At that point you're validating and condoning sexism. |||I guess under this definition every OMAD follower has BED...|||Enige kans dat je je database ergens openbaar hebt gemaakt?

I want to combine finances after we are married (or right before) and have shared savings with each getting a 'fun' budget. Whether everything goes to a single account or not, I don't care, as long as on paper we consider all money a shared pool. I will be the one with the higher income by the way. But here's the thing: in the past 6 to 7 years we've been together, we realized that: we both value savings, we both find the same things worth while to splurge on (travel, quality vs cost discussion on big ticket items), we both have the same needs and expectations for our future house, and we never feel like the other is wasting money even when it's still 'my' and 'his' money.We also have a shared account for bills and grocery. Our communication and collaboration surrounding this account has been amazing. Another reason that makes me extremely comfortable about pooling money.In your case.. I don't know. I would probably like you be in favour of keeping money more separated. |||Or you know, find an SO who is confident enough to not obsess about an ex?

Social introversion/extraversion does not have to match MBTI introverted/extraverted functions. |||The US is an interesting case all on its own, because it's one of the few western countries that really enforces jus solis, which means you get citizenship if you are born on US soil. In that case, it doesn't matter which nationality the parents have, as long as the kid is born in the US, the kid will be a US citizen *by birth*. The EU countries all uphold jus sanguinis, citizenship by blood. In that case, the kid is considered a citizen of the country/countries which which either or both parents are a citizen of, at the moment the kid is born. Crazy example: if woman A was born to a Dutch mother and German father (or vice versa), woman A is considered to be a citizen of both and can get both pasports. If man B was born to a French mother and Spanish father (or vice versa), man B is considered a citizen of both, and can claim both pasports.sIf woman A and man B would have a child on US soil, even if neither of them are an US citizen, their kid AB would have a legal birth right claim to all 5 nationalities. But if woman A decided to naturalize as a citizen of country X that requires renouncation of former nationalities in order to naturalize, she would no longer be a Dutch/German citizen by Dutch/German national laws. If she would birth a child to man B on US soil, the kid AB would not have a direct birth right claim to either Dutch or German citizenship (but would to Spanish, French, X, and US nationality), because the mom wasn't a citizen of those at birth of the kid. Even if the mom would *reclaim* her Dutch/German citizenship later in life based on her own birth right, and would renounce Turkish citizenship, the kid would still not have a birth right to Dutch/German citizenhip. In that case, if the kid would want Dutch or German citizenship, they'd have to find a way through heritage laws instead, opposed to jus sanguinis laws, which vary greatly between countries.|||Dear OP, your post has been removed as per rule 3: image post must be accompanied by a comment in which the OP discusses how the content of the image relates to increasing their productivity. |||Thanks for the idea.

My GP did this for me, and I turned out to be Vitamin D deficient and I had to specifically watch my iron intake a bit better. I cannot stress enough how much one tiny pill of Vitamin D supplements has helped to get my energy levels up. Like you, I had a very balanced and healthy diet, but my body had specific needs.More specific advice: the question asked by others of what exactly causes your exhaustion is very, very valid. You should probably think about this question both in the context of the 'right now' and in general. For example, /u/melkchup mentioned exhaustion from constant decision-making related thoughts. For me, this doesn't cause exhaustion, but itchy back of my mind anxiety (which I deal with the same way as /u/melkchup, by writing it down).For me, I only truly get exhausted when I'm sensory overstimulated. This often happens in social settings (loads of sounds, people talking, music playing, loads of movement, people bumping into me, etc.). At one point last winter, I started getting exhausted seemingly randomly throughout the week.. which was out of the ordinary. That's when I went to the GP only to find out I was Vit D deficient (probably made worse because of the lack of sun during winter).Try to establish patterns regarding your mental/physical health in relationship to your exhaustion.|||This might work, but that's something you'd like to have figured out before adding a bunch of people to the mod team. In those cases, mod privilege can also be selectively applied for specific jobs. Questions like; if we want to add a mod for wiki purposes, what will be the scope of her job? And what will happen to this purpose and her mod privilege once the wiki is up and running and only needs some very limited updating once every few months? Would this person leave the mod team? If they don't, what kind of role should this person have in more general mod discussions regarding non wiki related topics?These are all things to consider, because it will greatly impact the way this sub is run and because the sub is so small, I think you'd very quickly run into a 'too many queens in a castle' situation if you don't consider this up front (which in itself greatly impacts the way the sub is modded).|||You're a good friend.

How your network looks, depends on the goal. You don't 'network' to build the network, you only 'network' to use the connections and relationships you've build in your life in solving a problem.For example: finding a job in field x.In my experience, when it comes to finding a job, there are two types of connections. First there is the network of people you know that are already working at companies inside your field (note: not necessarily people *in* the field). Second, there is the network of people you know that don't work at companies in your desired field, but know people in it.The second parameter is the closeness of your connection with people inside your network. You can have solid connections, people who you could ask to ask around because you are looking for something (and they will) and loose connections who you could ask to let you know if they happen to come across something that might fit you.Ideally, you'd have lots of close connections from the first category. This could even be a cleaning lady or a receptionist! These people will poke around for you. To grow this network: keep in touch with the friends of your parents, and befriend older year students. However, this network is often quite limited in scope and also geography.To get some reach, you need close connections to people who know people in the field. These could be professors. If you have shown a lot of initiative and good work, you could approach a professor and ask them ' I would like to work in field x, would you happen to have any contacts in that field you could introduce me to?'. A professor will only do this if he/she considers you competent, as it's their reputation on the line. Then, the colder contacts in your network. That's a numbers game really. It's about telling a lot of people you know superficially *exactly* what you would like them to look out for, and asking them to let you know if they see something. Back to your question: 'networking' as used when describing building relationships through networking events is an empty bullshit term and doesn't give you any edge whatsoever. The edge comes from the network of people you know and your relationship to these people in relationship to their personal connections.You will not gain what you want from attending 20 networking events. Instead, do an extracurricular (research) project with prefessors you either don't know yet or want to build a better relationship with. Make friendships with people both in and outside of your desired field. Be conscious of who you know and what kind of relationship you have with them, and identify what kind of people you would still *like* to know or like to know better. Spend your time investing in these relationships (lunches, drinks, whatever) or put yourself in a position that will allow you to meet the type of people you'd like to build relationships with. You don't 'network' to build these relationships, 'networking' is something that comes only at the end when you solve a problem you're having through the connections you already built.|||First off: your notebook is *hilarious*.

I've seen my long term SO struggle with it (including treatment and meds) for years. That's why i commented the way I did.It's really important to separate emotion from ration, because your emotion is a trickster that is out to needlessly hurt you.

However, when looking up similar stories and questions online, I only found stories of people going all the way with fluid injections, several medication, etc etc and we felt we were being wrong about our thoughts and we were option for some kind of selfish convenience euthanasia. We discussed the comments in this thread as well, and we still feel that maybe euthanasia is already the best choice, even when he still has many many good days opposed to bad days. We already planned on visiting the vet (without pet) to discuss our feelings and ideas, and decided that we are not going to treat him further. If we do anything, it will be a house call by the vet to euthanize him. Which will likely be sooner than later. |||It doesn't matter. Loads of people don't realize this, but by law (unless a degree has limited places and does additional selection, med school for example), the degree programme needs to offer admission to anyone meeting the entry requirements.

Just look around on the websites to figure out exactly how many A levels/higher level IB exams you need and in which subjects.

Yes, many students *think* getting a degree from a Randstad university is beneficial in terms of getting a job, but when you look at employment rates of RUG master graduates, RUG graduates get employed just as quick or even quicker, also for jobs that are located at Randstad/Zuidas. Many Randstad companies also acknowledge that Groningen has quite a stricter grading culture (in the masters) than many other universities. So they now that when a Groningen student applies with a cum laude, it means something. This of course is also strongly degree dependent.  |||This.

But I would like to make an additional point: the field of chemE is changing, while traditionally chemE was all about process engineering (which indeed is very close to IE), the field is moving to *product* engineering more and more. Both are part of the chemE spectrum, however, product engineering is in many ways much closer to actual chemistry than it is to engineering. Product engineering chemE focuses not so much on fundamental chemistry research but how to use chemistry to develop products with the right properties, taking into account production and market feasibility. If this is the thing that interests you, know that this is a possibility within a chemE degree, but you'll need to find universities that are actually dedicating research to product engineering opposed to process engineering to get an education in this type of chemE. |||You have gotten a lot of good advice already about who you can contact.

It's actually quite easy to make use of this. Really generic example: Income based repayment is 4% of your income ABOVE minimum wage. Median wages in the Netherlands is ~2800/month, minimum income is around ~1600/month. That's a monthly billing of about ~50 euros/month on your loan repayment. 35 years equals 420 months, so that brings the total to about 21k you're repaying over those 35 years. That's also about the average student loan in this country. In my case, my student loan is about 3 times that average. No way I'm going to pay off the full sum.

Don't let others drag you down, making you unable to live the life you want. |||You're touching upon quite an interesting piece of history in Dutch education!As you probably know, at one point the educational systems got unified at a European level (the Bologna agreements on higher education). Interestingly, you'll find that bachelor degree at both a UoAS and academic universities are ranked equally in the European qualifactions framework. The distinction between UoAS and Universities is something very typical to just a handful of EU nations (Germany comes to mind as well for example) and very much rooted in history. Many of the degrees offered by Dutch UoAS are taught at 'regular' universities in many other countries.Before the Bologna agreements (so before the bachelor/master structure), academic education took 5 years. After graduating, a student would gain the titel of 'doctorandus', which translates from Latin to 'he who should become doctor'. It was a diploma that qualified you to start your doctoral research to gain the well known title dr. - doctor. From this perspective, the *academic* driven nature of education at our universities becomes very clear. University education was never meant to educate students for the job market, that's what a UoAS was for! Instead, the universities educated their students from a strong research driven perspective: loads of self-study, independent research, little hand holding, little practical/vocational teaching, etc. The UoAS on the other hand are very much vocational in nature: clearly defined homework sets, (in many cases) mandatory to show up in class, internships as part of the curricula, lots of hands on experience. This distinction worked pretty well for the Dutch job market. Obviously, getting a university degree was definitely not the norm and only a small percentage attended universities, while most people with the intellectual aptitude would study at UoAS institutions. But then Bologna happened and everything had to be split into the Bachelor/Master structure... This resulted in a rather arbitrary decision of splitting the traditional 5 year university education in a 3-year bachelor and 2-year master program, and over time, 1-year master programs started popping up as well. The fact that both UoAS and university bachelor degrees are ranked the same is - from a Dutch perspective - really weird, because the content and type of education is drastically different between the two. This is difficult for international students, but from a Dutch perspective, the historical differences between UoAS and universities is still very much in place: no student would start university programme with the *intention* to stop after a bachelors degree. Why? Because it's not a 'finished' education from our perspective (hindering entrance into the job market) and you'd be much better off getting a degree from a UoAS that properly prepares you for working life.Addendum: it's interesting to known as well that in Dutch language, we don't actually consider UoAS institutions to be *universities*. We call them 'hogescholen' which translates to 'high schools' as in 'school for higher education'. Obviously, this is seriously confusing in the English language and Anglosaxon tradition. In the Dutch language, we only call our academic institutions a university ('universiteit'). This again underlines the distinct different purposes between UoAS and universities in society.|||Not sure where the downvote came from, but anyway, let me put my comment in a bit more perspective (the same is by the way true for Germany). The system is simply different. Only a very specific type of education is called university level education in the Netherlands. It's only considered academic, when you actually do a scientific educational programme, which includes doing scientific research. Everything that's more vocational, will be considered an applied science, and will get you a diploma from a 'hogeschool' or School of Higher Education. Like the name suggests, it's still considered top tier higher education, it's just not a university degree. Examples would be how for example you can study nursing at a US university, but in the Netherlands (and Germany) it would be an applied science and wouldn't get you a university diploma. Anyway, I have had multiple family members who went to various US colleges on varsity scholarships, and when they came back were hit with the reality that their degrees wouldn't be recognized at university level by the Dutch government. These were all from state universities (one of them for example from the University of Denver), which are all ranked at around the 300 mark world wide. |||This sounds so familiar.

What would be a good degree that gives me plenty of opportunities in different types of career fields that I wouldn't totally hate studying? I ended up picking an engineering programme. It turns out I hate engineering, but I'm still going to finish it because I can and I'll have many options after graduating. It gets better. It really does.|||Look, everyone is allowed to have preferences regarding what they find attractive and what not in their SO. And everybody is also allowed to say: 'I am not attracted to this physical attribute and I won't date someone with that attribute'. At the same time: your body, your choice and at no times should someone force or guilt you to do something with your body you do not want.This is where your GF fucked up in her approach. Instead of stating her preference (and the possible consequence of her not wanting to date you anymore because of it), she said 'shave it, or else' which effectively made *you* the culprit in this situation. The 'fuck you' comment that followed confirmed this even more: if you have a beard, *you* will cause our break up, and that's the end of it.This woman seriously has very little mature communication skills. Imagine if the two of you are actually faced with *major* issues in your life and she also reacts like this to those issues.|||Are you familiar with the European system for language proficiency qualifications? It's called the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages or CEFR in short. CEFR is used a lot when talking about language proficiency because it has a very decent breakdown of \\\"can do's\\\" for each level. The levels are A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, and C2. With C2 being near native. The Chinese government will have you believe that HSK1 = A1 and HSK6 = C2, but that's *definitely* not the case. I would say HSK6 would put you at B2 level. You definitely would be able to use the language with ease, but you would not be near to even somewhat native. Google hsk to cefr and you'll find several conversion charts from different linguistic institutions that discuss this topic. |||I mean.. I happily *buy* soon to expire fruit. I go to my local market shortly before they close down. Usually I can get a full bag full of grapes, berries, mangos etc which are about to expire.. and yes.. some of the fruit will already have one or two mouldy patches.  Still, it's cheap nutrition, even if some of it is mouldy. Especially with strawberries it's easy. Unpack right when you're at home, toss the mouldy strawberries and keep the rest in the fridge on a plate so the fruit isn't touching each other. It will stay perfectly fine for at least a few more days and if any of the strawberries already started moulding without you spotting it, it won't spread as quick.For mouldy patches on mangos and stuff, I just cut those parts off and blend the remaining parts to make fruit juice. Needs to be consumed within a day or to, but it does mean I get plenty of portions of nutrient rich fruit which is too expensive for me to buy on a day to day basis for regular price at the local grocery store.|||I'm saving this post to show my own SO later so I can tell him how much I love and appreciate him for always making me feel beautiful, even when I'm down. Thank you for sharing.|||You know, for me at times sex it's also simply a logistical issue. I don't think many guys realize how incredibly *messy* it is for women to deal with the aftermath of sex (at least without condoms). Many times, I simply don't want to deal with the mess and clean up. At these times, I ask my SO whether he'd like a hand job, and to just snuggle up to me, while I actively kiss and touch him. This is a lot less emotionally intense for me when I don't feel in a good place, and I'm not bothered by the clean up, while he still gets his release (albeit less intense than with actual sex). Maybe ask your girlfriend if she's up for this? She still gets to participate actively, but it takes less time and effort from her, so it's much less of a claim on her energy for when she's not feeling like it. It would also make you feel less rejected. My SO starts raising his voice, because that's normal in his family. It isn't in mine, and the moment he does it, I get a bit fearful, because for me, raising your voice is equal to something being *very, very wrong*. It's good that you are aware of this and try to adjust, because this is such deep conditioning on her/our part that it's really not fair to ask *her* to get rid of the emotional connections to actions like these. (Although, as always, both of us should *try* to better ourselves, also in this regard.)I think the most important thing for you to realize is that her saying 'no' to sex, is simply that, she doesn't want to have sex. It is not a personal rejection of you, or your love for her, or your attractiveness. It's just.. not wanting to have sex. Maybe you should also do some introspection to find out for yourself what kind of actions, words, gifts, etc (see the comment on love languages!) boost your self esteem within your relationship, besides having sex. Once you know, you could also discuss this with your SO, and see if she can be a little more mindful of these other triggers to - so to say - compensate and make you feel more secure overall.|||I hated how they ruined her character towards the end of the series and made her have a baby.

Their focus on critical thinking (across disciplines), teamwork and self-actualization are key skills to succeed in Dutch higher education. I disagree with the other comment, I'd say *especially* for the sciences it's better to provide your child with a more broader skill set and expose them to humanities during their formative teenage years. It will make their first year at uni a bit tougher, but once they are past that, it will only be beneficial when they need to bring other skills and creativity into their work.

Yes, it stifles income potential, as not only does our country have high taxes on income, they put additional taxes and financial burden on the employer to pay for these social securities, which is a cut you don't even see back in your gross income at all. The average household income of the Netherlands is 30 to 35k a year, and if you'd earn double that, you'd be considered a very high income household. Comparing that to the US is of course simply absurd. HOWEVER, one thing that does not get talked about enough when this topic comes up in my opinion is the effect of these social policies on society, and how it changes the environment you as an individual live in. In this country, there are no 70 plus year old grandmas and grandpas working as cashiers at the local grocery store, nor do people end up homeless easily. There is little stress  compared to the US for children to take care of their parents if their finances are not in order to finance their retirement due to health reasons or simply because they were uneducated and lacked earning potential. Not being able to finance your retirement is simply NOT a point of discussion and you don't see the effects of not having these social securities in everyday life. This makes society as a whole much more nicer and comfortable to live in. I want to have a nice place to retire at, and not be confronted day in day out with the fact that although I did well for myself, 80 percent of other people around me did not and are in constant stress and fear, because living in such a society affects MY quality of life as well.|||Oh, I feel you on this one...Ok, two things: make sure you buy jeans that are made of a sturdy material. Fabric quality will definitely make a big difference. Once you see that your pants are thinning at a certain spot, or it started to rip, stop wearing those pants, take them to a tailor and they will reinforce that spot. They do so by essentially patching the spot on the inside with some hyper sturdy material. You can definitely see the patch stitching (though a decent tailor will make sure to match stitch colour with your pants as good as possible), but it's not super visible, as people won't be looking at your crotch in detail to begin with.The trick is not to wait until it's actually fully ripped up, but take preventive measures once the fabric starts to fail. |||This is actually pretty common!

And if you fuck up rapport on that account with those type of people, there is little to come back from as you've broken with some of their core values.I don't *disagree* with you on using Se and Fi more effectively in our own communication, that's definitely really good advice, I'm just saying that the form of that type of communication is highly cultural dependent, and if you are using it strategically and consciously, you better damn know the playing field you're in.|||Having 5 to 10 years relevant experience in the field to a point you can consider yourself having a solid background in your chosen niche with accompanying skills that are valuable and are ready to take on more leadership based roles.IB is a tough field to emigrate with honestly.. as a fresh graduate, you're not bringing much to the table that's valuable compared to any natives (who will all have master degrees anyways). |||Look ahead a bit further than your upcoming decision. What is your alternative? Will you choose something easy instead, because you don't *want* to struggle and rather just coast through things? Ok, what will be next? A job. What kind of jobs do you expect to get, both for your engineering degree as well as your unnamed alternative? What will your career look like? Can you get a job easily with your alternative? If not, do you expect working 60 plus hours on minimum wage to simply get by will be easy and carefree?My point is, life is hard. If not academically, it will be due to employment problems, or growth potential problems. You either need to work hard to be adequate in an in demand field, or work hard to be the best in a field with very few opportunities. If you're not willing to work hard in that regard, you'll have to work hard in other ways, hours you put in for example. |||Well, Im a female ENTJ who ended up with an INTP.. Im curious though, why are you only interested in women younger than you?|||I actually read the whole thing. Interesting article, thanks for sharing! Learned something new today.|||I'm guessing you're a guy that &gt; 6 foot? OP is female, and although she didn't put stats up, even if she is average length, you can't 'just' save some calories for fun. I'm 5'5 for example, my TDEE is like 1700. If I want to lose weight, I have to restrict at around 1200-1400 kcal and even then, the process will be *slow*. I can't just save 1000 for drinking like that. Sure, I could move more, but also realize that working out as a shorter, lighter female, you'd burn less calories. Burning an extra 1000 kcal to compensate would be 2 hours of super intense training (say HIIT for example), or 3 hours of less intense training (Zumbo, cardio, swimming etc.). And quite frankly, to do that kind of exercise, I would need to eat extra on top of that 1200-1400 kcal to just get the necessary energy to be able to last through the workout. Now imagine being a small female  at &lt; 5 foot, and your TDEE drops to 1400... at those kind of TDEE's, having a 2 beers equals a full meal.  Yes, it's about routine. Sadly, for many women, that really just means coming to the realization that some behaviours (such as weekly game nights with several beers + snacks) simply aren't sustainable. |||Except that most of these women already obtained their driving licenses from neighboring countries (which automatically granted you a Saudi driving license under their new law) and have plenty of driving experience, only not on Saudi Arabian territory. |||True, though instead of 'not universal' I would categorize it as 'really rare'.|||This is what's so fucked up about the American system (from an outsiders perspective).

I think there might be one very simply rule you could implement that would improve both your diet and mental health: absolutely no eating while in front of a computer screen. If you get hungry while working, get up, take a short walk, go to the kitchen/canteen/whatever, get your food, sit down somewhere else besides your office with no screens taking away your attention, and focus on eating your food. And recalculate your TDEE, based on your now very sedentary lifestyle. Obviously, the same eating patterns which you had 6 years ago will most likely still lead to a weight gain, considering you are not as physically active as before. You will need to adjust and eat 'even less' compared to when you were in weight loss mode last time.|||Yeah, in always knew I was smart, I just never put in the effort. That also changed when I got a bit older an realized that I didn't get any pride from actual achievements, but from the effort I put it. Doing my best made me feel satisfied with what I was doing, irrespective of the results.|||In my experience, ENTJs systematically underappreciate the effects on both social and work success of 'being liked'. At one point, you might be the 'best' in whatever you do, but people will prefer to promote somebody that has a strong interpersonal and likable persona, even if they are not the 'best'. They say ENTJs have 'natural charisma'. In my opinion, nothing is 'natural' about it. It is learned: learned by ENTJs who realized this and put a lot of effort in developing their personality and how their personality comes across. ENTJs who didn't do this are anything but charismatic: they come across as assholes to everyone but themselves.Now back to your post: you spend several paragraphs discussing your achievements (be it work, school, or looks) and not a single word is said about what *your* interpersonal value is to others. What is your value as a person that would make you interesting as a friend or love interest? Why would people want be your friend? You say:Apparently that's the image you are showing in your non-verbal communication. Of course nobody wants to be friends (or coworkers for that matter) with somebody who thinks they are better than others simply because they work hard and lucked out in the genetic lottery in terms of intelligence and a disposition for discipline. *Why would they?*My advice: have a careful look at why *you* (and not your achievements!) bring value to the table in interpersonal relationships and think about how you are communicating this to the world. |||It's not only water weight. If I remember correctly, a female body that's close to ovulation simply burns more calories due to hormonal changes that influence metabolism, and the amount burned drops again during menstruation. It's not a lot, maybe like a shift of 100 kcal up or down from the 'average' BMR, but yeah, female bodies are a lot less stable in time compared to men's bodies. But again: that doesn't invalidate CICO.|||Did I read your question correct in that you're interested in getting EU health insurance to cover you while you're still living in the USA? 'Cause that's not going to work. For example, my insurance does cover me when I travel abroad, also outside of the EU, but only to a certain maximum number of months when you're consequetively out of the country. They'd tell you to get local insurance if you're going to settle in another country for more than half a year to a year or so. Also, my health insurance has a very specific clause for US travel: they only cover what is considered a 'fair price'. A simple blood test that the hospital charges several 100s for but would have been done for maybe 20 euros in my home country.. yeah, my insurance will have issues with that.|||I wouldnt look into it too much. The anxiety can really fuck up your perception of social interaction, seeing hostility when there is none. Especially when talking to your psych... that's a really vulnerable position to be in, so being more guarded is really normal. This interaction makes me think about a recent GP visit I had. I wanted to discuss the chances of me going through early menopause as my mom was 33 when she started. At one point she said: 'I heard you saying you don't want children. Because if you do, be aware that this would be a good time in your life to discuss options such as freezing your eggs or extending your fertility in other ways.' It wasn't necessarily dismissive of me being CF, it was simply my GP making sure I had all potentially relevant information to make an informed decision about what path to take with my health and my body.|||I actually had a paid subscription to this news outlet for a few years. The preachy holier than thou vibe is what made me cancel my subscription in the end. I definitely agree with your opinion on De Correspondent: amazing content, but the *tone* could be more impartial and unbiased (even if the content itself is presented impartial and unbiased, because it is, and I do want to stress that element!). |||Am Dutch so I bike each and every day, regardless of weather or temperature. I seriously do not adjust anything about my wardrobe just because I'm on a bike, so I'm not sure what problem you are specifically facing.. Sure, you would not wear a short skirt in the middle of winter, but in summer, why not? Are you going out and want to wear stilettos.. sure no problem, if you can walk in them you can bike in them. I think the trick is getting a set of coats for all weather types you're facing. Water resistant coats come in various types, and in the beginning of autumn when it starts raining a lot, you want something water tight, but not something that will make you feel sweaty because it's still quite warm outside. Once it's winter and freezing outside, it's a different story again. I have about 5 coats or so that get cycled throughout the year. Also, rain pants. Simple plastic pants which you can pull over your regular pants or skirts for when it's raining, and they told up into this tiny little bag to store them away. I keep a pair at home and at work.|||I mean this sincerely: please don't let this so single removal stop you from posting to this sub again!

I have quite a few form fitting skirts, so having high waist underwear that aligns with the skirt just looks nicer (and way, way more comfortable compared to a g-string for example).|||Fun fact: the Netherlands does not have the death penalty. Also, sentencing someone for life is an extremely rare verdict in the Netherlands, saved for only the most severe cases. There are maybe 50 people serving out a life sentence at the moment on a total population of 17 million. Maximum sentencing (outside of getting life) is 30 years.This all has to do with the Dutch stance on prison not being 'punishment' but mandatory 'rehabilitation'. Sentences are generally short, and prisons provide all kinds of mental care and educational programmes to reintegrate people in society after they fulfilled their sentence. Those getting live are considered the absolute basket cases for whom reintegration in society will simply never be an option.Our prisons are so empty as a result, we rent them out to neighbouring countries.|||Dear OP, I removed this post as per sub rules. Cover pages are not allowed on r/bujo.|||First: I feeeeeel you on the rage. I really, really , really do. It's like.. you can feel these hidden depths to you and your mind behind this thin curtain just beyond your reach. If only you could just reach an inch closer to pull the curtain off and everything will be clear.My answer will be seriously unsatisfying. It's not a curtain. It's an onion. It's layered and you'll have many layers to peel. Then again, this is also a good thing, because each layer is within reach and you will feel that kick of accomplishment with every peeled away layer just like you do (or did) with more conventional 'successes'.What set me on my path was quite drastic actually. Serious sports accident. Left me seriously ill and in pain for 2 years. Had to come to terms with my physical limitations and the consequences of not fulfilling my full potential at the time. Made me (actually, forced me to) seriously think about what was actually important to me and my life. I do recommend it to any ENTJ to consciously place yourself in a situation totally outside of *you* if that makes sense and really focus on the experience in itself (get that Se working). Something like volunteering to work with desperate homeless people and instead of focussing on 'how can this soup kitchen be more efficient?' focussing on 'do I really understand what these people are going through?' will really help in developing in Fi .  Sounds silly, because our instinct tells us this is totally useless and wasted time.. My opinion: that first onion layer is simply a function of time spend on nothing else but you and your feelings while expecting nothing in return. Placing yourself in a situation that forces you to confront yourself (like helping homeless people) helps you in doing that. Just like being in pain and depending on your loved ones for everything because you're  functionally disabled will allow you a lot of time to just be and think.I feel like I'm past those first layers by now. Personally, I spend a lot of time in semi-meditative state to get more in touch with my physical body (long distance walking, swimming, pilates).. but it took me many years to actually get to this point.For me right now: Wealth generation is still very much on the radar, except it being a consequence of what it is I want to do, and not just the goal in itself.|||Yesss!

Maybe not for morbidly obese classes, but overweight/obese people can definitely be *fit* (as in having muscle strength, stamina, etc.), just like how normal weight people can have not fitness whatsoever. Fitness in itself has health effects, regardless of weight, and unfit normal weight people will still have to deal with the negative health consequences of not being fit. Sure, ideally you'd be both fit and have a healthy weight, but I definitely can see how people make the distinction with regard to health. |||I'm so jealous. I'm female with a TDEE of 1700.

You need to contact local universities for example to get more insight into salaries in your region. Save to say, it would be less than computer scientists, statisticians, or engineers of course, but based on your post, that doesn't seem a viable option for you anyway (the reason why they pay so much more is because so few people have the skills to do those jobs).|||Any study loans? Salaries in Europe are really not comparable to US salaries, due to many things being paid for by the government, opposed to having to pay for them out of pocket. Not a problem (just different) in terms of quality of living and living standards, but if you have US level debts, that might become a problem. FYI, a fulltime salary for a PT in the Netherlands is likely to be in the 25-35k euros/year range, this is pre-tax though, so that would be 20-28k (ish) take home salary.|||Tja, wat je er ook van vindt, het is wel een belangrijk element om deze discussie rondom internationals in Groningen te kunnen plaatsen. Het is niet zo simpel als 'stop dan met het toelaten van die studenten'.  En de politiek heeft (ondanks dat dit probleem in *veel* steden speelt) geen enkel blijk gegeven dat ze er ook maar over na willen denken om de poorten ietsjes meer de sluiten en scholen meer te laten selecteren. Wil je nu selectie doen binnen een opleiding dan moet je dat namelijk 1.5 tot 2 jaar van tevoren bij het ministerie aanvragen, mocht dus deze zomer blijken dat er opleidingen serieuze issues gaan hebben met instroom: pech gehad, je mag pas selecteren vanaf september 2020, mits het überhaupt wordt goedgekeurd door de minister.|||Ok, just to be sure... but you do know InHolland is not a full fledged university (like TU Delft for example), but instead a university *of applied science*, or 'hogeschool' in Dutch, which roughly means school for higher education, opposed to a 'universiteit'? I personally know quite a few internationals who came to the Netherlands thinking they would get a university education... only to find out that was not the case when they got here because they did not realize there was a difference between university and university of applied science. InHolland offers what we call 'Hoger beroepsonderwijs' or 'higher vocational education' in English. Although the educational quality of these 'hogeschool' institutions is really high and definitely not something to look down on (although InHolland itself had some scandals in the past regarding educational quality...), the educational practices are distinctly different from that of a universities. It's vocational in nature, not scientific/academic. Again.. just to be sure.|||Thank you for the sub suggestions! I'm definitely going to take a look. I do however think a dedicated bujo productivity sub like r/bujo has value, for the simple fact that if you use bujo as your main planning system, there is no point in filling up your feed with reviews of and posts about other systems. |||In my country, you can take your final exam in maths in several different formats. The 'easier' format focusses more on statistics why the more 'difficult' format contains calculus etc (and we have a 'super easy' format for those who really struggle with maths). Obviously, you need the latter to study a maths intensive STEM degree, but the former is fine for anything else, while the super easy format might not get you in economics, but will grant you entry in a language or history degree for example.My university did a study on how well grades can be predicted based on study results. And guess what, there is an absolute one on one correlation between high school maths grades and university grades. This doesn't only hold for STEM but also art history for example regardless of the type of maths that was chosen in High School. I believe the only exception they found was theology/religious studies, where there was an inverse relationship (but the sample size of that degree was tiny to begin with).So no, maybe calculus in itself doesn't say much, but mathematical capability does correlate to academic success, even if your field doesn't require maths at all.. something something abstract reasoning ability is important in any scientific field you're in.|||Well, I just learned through your post the dining table I spend my whole youth on is a LC table. Doesn't surprise me, my mum is a nut for designer furniture.

The one my parents bought should be close to 20 years old now, and it is still looking absolutely stunning and brand new.

All of which clashes with my belief around parenthood: In this overpopulated world, I *truly* belief only those people who fully aspire parenthood should have children. People who are born and live for parenthood. Who would love, nourish and support a child under any conditions and above all else. Yes, when you have children, the relationship between you and your SO still takes priority as a good relationship provides the foundation of raising happy children, but you as a *family unit* should put the needs of the child(ren) above anything else. The children come first, and should come first, because *you* decided to bring this child into the world. The child owes you nothing, you owe it *everything*.Frankly, if for example I would get an (even mildly) autistic child which would bind me to one place the rest of my life as my child needed stability, not allowing me to follow my own dreams, I could not get over my resentment because I wouldn't be able to *truly* and selflessly put the needs of this hypothetical child above my own. In the end, my SO and I concluded parenthood is not for us. If we were to have children, it would be to fulfill the typical societal 'ideal' of family and not because it is our purpose in life.|||Yup. |||Funny, I actually find most of your 'kind' types to be insincere and fake, which is in my eyes, anything but kind.

Yeah, it sounds like she's being an ass, but her comment *is* sincere and comes from a place of great care and love for me. |||Just writing to let you know your comment has had quite an impact on me. I do brush regularly, but my dental hygiene isnt as up to par as it should be. Frankly, lately I've been pretty sloppy and thinking, oh what the hell, I have health care insurance, a single cavity more or less really isnt going to be an issue... well obviously, it is. The thing is, I've never actually been explained why it is an issue in the way you just did, even though I enjoyed high quality education throughout my life. Your comment seriously changed my view on dental hygiene. Thank you.|||After I read about the 'no rinse' online, I did my research. Various governmental health agencies advice not to rinse after brushing (NHS and Australian public health department). Also, I looked up whether there was any recent academic literature on the topic (this was quite a while ago, I don't have a ref list available right here, right now, but if you're interested, I'll get you a list of references), and also from what I've read in the academic literature, there seems to be plenty of support for not rinsing after brushing. The literature that I found mostly discussed how, of course, if you compare rinsing/not rising to inconsistent brushing (not doing your 2-3x a day), there is little difference between rinsing or not rinsing. But still, non-rinsing brings fluoride levels in saliva to a higher concentration in line with what clinical research has identified as beneficial to dental health - a concentration that by *far* is not high enough to cause fluorosis. Fluoridated drinking water makes you ingest far more fluoride. The benefits of using fluoride in general has been proven time and again in clinical trials as well.. so I'm really not sure why the dentists you worked for do not care for acting on scientific data. Also, the whole story on flossing kinda came out of nowhere, no? At least, I didn't comment on it in my original post. But you are definitely right. Also this is proven time and again in clinical trials to be beneficial for your dental health. |||This is why I banned peanut butter all together from my home. I *looooove* PB.

Any prevention method *will* fail when a storm gets bad enough, the question is, what kind of storm will that be? Most of US flood prevention installations are built to withstand storms up to a risk of once in a 100 years. Meaning that the theoretical worst storm that could occur in a 100 year perspective will make the system fail. Global warming however makes the chances of these types of storms occuring higher, so even though this might seem safe enough, it really isnt. Now, lets compare that to the Dutch situation: The Dutch systems operate on a once in 4000 years (and in critical areas even once in 10000 years) systems.

I mean, it's nice your family is on your side, but you're potentially talking about 10s of thousands of euros/dollars in lost value on the home if they fuck you over which you might not be able to claim back through court if you don't take all precautions.. support of your family won't protect against those losses and what will she care if you actually cut her out.

I mean: the EU is a union *between* independent, sovereign countries. The EU has very little power in its own right, as it fully depends on reaching agreement among member states, because each sovereign country needs to independently enact what the EU politicians envision. Being an EU citizen, it seems like nothing but logical to me that each country will have their own immigration laws. I guess the name 'blue card' maybe is a bit misleading, but still, the US is a single country (with a single federal immigration process) while the EU is not. |||Dear OP, your post has been removed as per rule 2: cover pages are not allowed on this sub.|||First point of advice:1. Don't be an idiot and overspend.Based on what you wrote, you already seem to have to figured out quite well. So, this will be the second point of advice which might be more of a challenge to you:2. Don't be an idiot and pass up on opportunities *because* they cost money.One of the reasons why university is valuable is because of all the opportunities they provide outside of getting your degree. What's a good opportunity for you depends on entirely on your ambitions and goals. But if for example going abroad for a semester fits those goals, don't *not* do it, simple because it will set you back a few grand, if in the end, it will improve your prospects.It's really a balancing act.|||Groningen (the city in which this picture actually was taken) was part of the Hanseatic League.|||I just had a look at that site.. a week long volunteering trip incl. food and accommodation is only 300-400 euros.

I don't agree with many of the people here talking about how MBTI E/I related to 'where you get your energy from'. If you read up on functions you'll see that E/I is about your main way of how you process information: either from the real world outside in, or by internal digestion inside out. The energy thing is independent from that notion, which is usually what people would conventionally call introversion and extraversion. This is what I mean with being an introverted ENTJ. I am definitely a dominate Te user, even though social interaction is generally exhausting and I need several hours of high quality alone time very single day to cope and recharge. The thing is, the function thing is not an overall agreed upon concept in MBTI world. Meaning that sometimes you'll come across tests that try to test for functions, and some try to test for dichotomies. On top of that, some online tests are simply shit. This gives flakey results when you compare them. Best to leave the tests alone, read up on functions and judge for yourself which type you are through thorough, honest self reflection.|||I had a look at the SGHG website. I don't know anyone who rented with them, but the rooms look brand new, with nice furniture etc. Definitely more upscale. You are going to pay a premium even for regular, 'non international' housing at that location. It's at Hoge der Aa, which is one of the most desirable (and expensive!) housing locations in the city center. SSH will also charge you relatively more compared to finding a room through a network of friends and family Dutch students would typically use to find a room, but yes, SGHG is definitely still more expensive, though not by much. The newest SSH building (Upsilon) will maybe be 50-100 euros cheaper a month. The older buildings runs a bit cheaper, maybe 100-150 euros cheaper compared to SGHG (but again, the quality of the rooms will be less as well). I believe marketing is an MSc at the Faculty of Economics and Business? In that case, be aware you'll have lectures at Zernike, and not the city center. If you'd study in the city center, you'd likely not even need a bike to get to uni from the SGHG location, but Zernike will still be a 10 minute ride. |||This is also not true. Universities get funding through tuition in two ways: student paid tuition and state funding for each diploma the University delivers. Every NL or EU students pays a relatively small amount in tuition, because the state will give the University additional funding after the student received their diploma. The state will not pay this additional diploma funding for non EU students, meaning their tuition fees must cover the full cost of the degree program in itself.The law states that non EU tuition fees must be reasonable and based on the actual cost of education. I admit, there are national discussion about what exactly is this cost of education, but at the RUG, when you compare 3 year non EU tuition vs 3 year EU tuition + subsequent state funding, it's comparable.Sure, you could argue improved cash flow (money now, opposed to later), but in general, the Dutch unis are very financially healthy, and cash flow is not a problem for them to begin with. Tldr: non EU students are not the cash cows they are believed to be by the general public.|||It's not about the name and whether or not your grandma is exerting power over you *through* the name. It's about the fact that she's exerting power of you. What kind of relationship do you want with her in your life? What kind of relationship do you want your children to have with her? Those are the questions you need to answer first, before you decide on which name you're giving the child and whether or not you're willing to change your original plan for the name. |||You got a lot of answers already. I had a quick look through your responses and it seems to me you have a very libertarian/individualistic outlook on life and morality. That's totally OK. I'll give you a **non**-medical reason why *you* benefit from socialized healthcare. You as an individual live in a society and although you as an individual can be fully responsible about your own life, you still live out that live in a larger society. The quality of that society directly and indirectly influence your life. If you life in a society where people are healthy, where there is little overall felt financial stress, where 70+ year grandamas and grandpas do not have to struggle as a cashier to just have a bit of income, where there are very few beggars on the street, where 8 o clock news is not littered with local despair about the next 5 year old dying because the parents can't afford chemo, where people you see around you are overall generally happy instead of ill-ish and stressed all the time, etc, etc etc.. *your* life will be better for it because like it or not, you are consciously or subconsciously affected by your surroundings.I live in a social welfare state, and the general happiness and level of health have a profound effect on my own well being. The point is, whether you like it or not, yes your money will be spend on those who are generally irresponsible. Whether that is fair or not.. like you read in the comments, that's very much debatable. The point is, a *very, very* large part of the population is indeed not responsible enough to take care of themselves properly. Yet that same large part will influence society as a whole quite a lot, and as such, they will effect *you* and your living conditions.From that perspective, providing socialized healthcare is a very cheap method for the individual to get the most output and effect on the whole population.|||An update regarding the state of moderation (10/11/18).

Unless you are financially set, the first prep for *any* type of emergency is to have readily accessible emergency savings.It's typically recommended to have 3 to 6 months of your monthly budget and bills in emergency savings, depending on your personal circumstances. So no 'we have savings for a car which can be spend on emergencies' but an actual, proper emergencies only savings. Unless this is already taken care off, the 50 bucks should go into emergency savings before jumping down the rabbit hole of getting bags, guns, tools, emergency rations, and God knows what else.I get that this answer probably isn't as sexy as you're hoping it would be, but it is the most rational and practical one.|||You're spot on. I'm a Te dominant as an ENTJ and far more introverted than my SO who is an INTP. People and social interactiom exhaust me, especially if it's frivolous chit chat or loud, intense parties. I can get energy from socialization if interesting topics are discussed, but that energy is gained from my mind developing new insights, and not the social interaction itself..  more like a net to surplus of energy in those cases. There are very few people who don't drain my energy. I need some serious daily downtime to be alone and recharge like typical introverts.An introverted dominant can be extroverted socially and vice versa.

Ik heb daardoor ongeveer de helft van het bedrag wat jij nu beschikbaar hebt. Ik merk dat deze sub erg.. conservatief is als het gaat om de DUO lening vanuit een risico perspectief, maar de voorwaarden zijn gewoon dusdanig goed dat ik dat risico geen probleem vind (zeker omdat ik in een vakgebied zit met hoge salarissen en veel werkgelegenheid).Anyway: Ik heb zelf standaard 6-7k op een spaarrekening staan. Zodra collegegeld betaald moet worden gaat het hier vanaf en wordt het zsm weer bijgevuld. Deze 6-7k is buffer voor 'ik heb nu geld nodig' zaken (denk aan: wasmachine kapot) maar simpelweg ook voor het geval je een geweldige kans tegenkomt, bijvoorbeeld een gave stage in het buitenland die niet volledige kosten dekkend is. In dat geval wil je gewoon cash beschikbaar hebben. De rest zit in ETFs. Ik zit zelf bij Binck, niet de goedkoopste (volgens mij is dat DeGiro), maar wel erg gebruiksvriendelijk met een bizar goede klantenservice. Ik merkte dat ik de eerste paar maanden toen ik begon iedere week toch weer inlogde om even te checken hoe het ging. Nu is dat maar eens in de zo veel maanden omdat ik denk 'oh ja, hoe zal het daarmee gaan?'. Ik heb zelf een deel in S&amp;P500 zitten, een deel in de EU en een deel in Emerging Markets (al is EM wel een stuk risicovoller/volatiel). Je kunt het jezelf ook makkelijk maken door alles in een wereld ETF te stopppen. Het vonds heeft dan zelf een spreiding over de verschillende markten. Een ding om op te letten (waar ik zelf tegen aan liep) is dat er een verschil zit in ETFs die dividend direct uitkeren (dan krijg je het dus op je broker rekening gestort) en die dividend opnieuw investeren in het fonds. Ik had dit dus niet door (want ik kijk niet zo vaak), waardoor ik plotseling een random potje aan geld op mijn Binck rekening had. Nu heb ik ETFs die het herbeleggen. Het grootste 'issue' wat je voor jezelf moet bepalen is of je er mee om kunt gaan dat de waarde van je beleggingen dus plotseling lager kunnen zijn. Iedereen zei steeds dat dit zo'n grote stress factor zou zijn, ook vanwege leeftijd enzo.. nou, zoals ik al van mezelf had verwacht, heb ik hier persoonlijk dus echt helemaal geen probleem mee. Maar goed, dit is iets wat je voor jezelf moet nagaan. Also: ik ga in het nieuwe stelsel afbetalen. Zelfs al gaat overheid naar 10-jaars gemiddelde van de obligatierente (nu is het 5 jaar), ze hebben al toegezegd dat dat voor ons ongewijzigd blijft. Daarnaast, doe het sommetje.. mijn vriend en ik hebben beiden zo'n bedrag aan studieschuld, en mocht je de originele schuld - zonder rente! - af willen betalen in 35 jaar, moeten wij een minimaal gemiddeld inkomen van 10k/maand hebben over die 35 jaar. En over de ethische verantwoording? We zijn genoeg gefuckt met dit leenstelsel. Toen het voorlag in de 2de kamer zijn ze er expliciet op gewezen dat de DUO leningen voor de doeleinde gebruikt kan gaan worden zoals wij dat doen, en de minister zei: dat is prima. Dat is ethische verantwoording genoeg voor mij.|||You probably do know some women with extreme period pains, who were simply socialized not to show and bite through the pain, *because* so many people don't take it seriously and they are used to getting pushed aside by people.

Blijf het eerste jaar thuisworden, word lid van je studievereniging (al is het maar voor de kortingen boeken etc), ga rondkijken bij studentenverenigingen en sportverenigingen, en ga tijdens je eerste jaar gewoon simpelweg zo veel mogelijk *meemaken* en beleven. Zoek uit wat je leuk en belangrijk vindt. Als je besluit te wisselen van studie.. nou en? Als je besluit bij Vindicat lid te worden en je stopt halverwege de ontgroeningen.. nou en? Gewoon *doen* en ervaren. Wees lekker impulsief en leer jezelf kennen. Gebruik het thuiswonen en de buffer die je daardoor hebt als een ultiem vangnet om nóg meer van je studententijd te kunnen ervaren dan je medestudenten.Tegen de tijd dat je in je tweede jaar zit, heb je genoeg punten via Woningnet voor een mooie containerstudio van 20 m2 incl. *huursubsidie*. Die huursubsidie maakt het level op jezelf in een klap een behoorlijke stukje goedkoper. Je weet daarna ook een stuk beter wat je wil en wie je bent. Maakt het op jezelf wonen simpelweg ook makkelijker.Maar nogmaals: VANDAAG nog inschrijven bij woningnet. Je spaart namelijk per week punten. Of je nou besluit nu, later, of pas als je een partner hebt om mee samen te wonen een woning te zoeken, je toekomstige zelf gaat je dankbaar zijn voor die woningnet inschrijving. Die 20 euro inschrijfkosten per jaar is het waard. In het ergste geval heb je ~100 euro verspild aan het eind van je studie als je geen gebruik maakt van je inschrijving, in het beste geval heb je een ontzettend mooie woning waar je iedere maand een paar 100 euro op gaat besparen t.o.v. vrije markt huurwoningen. |||There is a post somewhere down the comment section by a deleted user where they said they removed themself as a mod from the sub, freeing it for a Reddit request.|||I see a big difference between subconscious discriminatory behaviour caused by social programming and racism or sexism. In my opinion, being racists or sexists require some sort of conscious and deliberate thought proces. But fine, if that's not your definition: I guess I am racist in that case. As is probably every single person in western societies, even black people or people from other minorities themself. Even you. I guess that would also make me, and everybody else, and you, a sexist. And that's exactly the problem and why we need affirmative action.|||I also agree that what you experienced was absolute shit. Your edit however irks me in a very wrong way. The barrier for entry for women is higher than men. Not because the 'formal' requisites are different between men and women (we both need to have a certain diploma), but because of many social barriers which actively discourage women to get *into* STEM, which have led to *a lot* of subconscious biases that disenfranchise women *in* STEM.Saying that 'artificially reducing the barriers of entry' is a bad thing, while following up with 'women and men should have the exact same barrier to entry' are just not compatible statements. If you google/look on reddit/whatever, you'll find plenty of stories on how women were actively not welcomed into the STEM community. On top of that, there are plenty of John vs. Jane studies that show that women are simply *not* considered equal to men, even if they have exactly the same qualifications. This problem is way deeper than 'let's celebrate women and give them a golden crown for just being there!'. Again: I agree, what you experienced is shit, because you lost the competition due to not having a vagina. Now, imagine it the other way around. Imagine being a girl and facing that same shit. Having your family, teachers, parents, friends etc tell you at every corner during your youth that you can't do something, you can't win, because you are a girl. Of course, they don't outright tell you this, just like the judges didn't outright tell you 'you lost because you are a boy', but inside, you know the true reason. Just *imagine* having to feel what you are now feeling from age 6-7 onward every time you try to express interest in something STEM related. At one point, you just give in and don't try to compete anymore, because, well.. you can't win. That's the sexism we're up against. THAT is the barrier for women we need to lower.|||Damn. I live in a 'socialized healthcare' country, however, contraceptives are NOT covered under the basic insurance package for women above 21 years of age.

The price for generic brand combination pil is about 15 euros for a year supply.... how on earth is it possible such differences exist, even when paying out of pocket.|||Crossing the border to request asylum is a **legal** entry in case you didn't know.

I'm also a student. I have a couple of essentials in my bujo:At the beginning of each semester/block of new courses, I make several master lists in which I make an overview of each and every deadline per course, plus a small table in which I can track my grades as they come along. These pages get used *really* often, so I definitely recommend this.Next is my monthly overview. I am very conscious about what I put in. Obviously deadlines, but I only put in other 'events' if they require action on my part. Stuff like key meetings that require some prepping, but not coffee or lunch dates with people. Also, pro tip: Be sure to include the first 3-5 days of the *next* month as well in your monthly spread. This helps you be conscious of any deadlines that are for example scheduled on the first of the month. Then my main layout: I take a double page, and on the left, there's a weekly (literally just a title with 'week of ...' with a single line underneath and that's it), and on the right, I section the page in monday through friday. In principle, everything goes on the weekly list (and notes at the very bottom of the page if needed, but it doesn't have a dedicated section), and only the key to dos get moved to a specific day. I only put a maximum of 5 items to a day, but more often, it's just 3 or even 2. These items HAVE to be crossed off by the end of the day, that's my main objective and forces me to stay focused and on track (that's why there can't be too many of them!). When I have some time left after finishing that days to do's, I look back at the weekly list and do whatever I feel like / can finish in the available time frame. When a daily item doesn't get crossed of that day, it migrates to the next, and it NEEDS to be the first thing I do in the morning. |||So, you'd need to use a quarter of the amount seen on the scales in your pictures to have your ~750mg of sunscreen...That's...  really really little product in my opinion.

I don't believe 'life' has objective meaning. Life simply exists. We are born, we breath, we eat, we sleep, and at one point.. we die. Our act of living is not meaningful, it just *is*. This is not a bad thing in my opinion. To me, life not having meaning means you are absolutely free to do *whatever the fuck you want* with your life and have those choices be valid as much as any other choice. The only question that matters is: what do you *want*? If you want to do nothing your whole life and drink beer on your porch, that's just as valid as having the ambition to be a CEO one day of a big multinational. My 'want' in life is quite simple: I don't know exactly where I'll go and what I'll do in life, but I just want to see how far I can get. I keep doing more and more, and also more ambitious and daring things as time goes on, simply because I want to see whether I can.

I have a small comment which most likely won't apply to you, but I'm leaving it here just in case... It would surprise you how many people never learned how to *properly* wash and clean themselves as a child (fat and skinny people alike). Especially if you gained a lot of weight during your teens/adulthood this might be a problem, because like you already note, cleaning yourself becomes more difficult when you're bigger and at those ages, you don't have your parents anymore joining you in the bathroom to show you and teach you how to wash yourself. Everyone knows you should have regular showers, which means standing under a stream of water and that soap is involved to clean yourself with, but nobody is ever really explicit about the details. Like I said, I don't think it applies to you, but I do recommend *everyone* to just take a few minutes and look up some \\\"how to take a shower\\\" videos on YouTube. Yes, this is a thing. It's good to check whether these habits you've had your whole life are actually the right habits. It was watching videos like these how I for example learned I've been brushing my teeth wrong all my life: apparently, you shouldn't rinse your mouth with water after brushing your teeth (it washes away the fluoride) , but just spit out the toothpaste instead.

I was about to comment the same when I read OP's post. - Sincerely, an extremely introverted ENTJ who needs several hours of alone time a day to even function because people are exhausting. |||Ok, dude, this was an awesome response, I honestly think we are pretty much in agreement here. The only thing I wanted to add: the image you're sketching in this totally more nuanced than your original comment (which quite honest came across as 'hurr, durr, I'm an angry man and women are to blame' - again, ugly internet generalization). In the end: society, media, all that shit, that's US like you already said, and the way you're presenting you argument now is *so much more* conducive to actually changing that general perspective on the issue of gender equality.From my own personal experience, it's often not the *question* itself that's bothersome. It's the *person* who's asking the question. It's about this person who comes over just too often, and starts asking questions that turn out to be uncomfortably personal too soon, followed by: 'soooo.... do you have a booooyfriend?'. It's never about the guy who simply asks that question out of genuine interest. It's also about a bigger issue: trying to discuss feeling uncomfortable about this persons behaviour with your coworkers and boss, and them not taking you seriously 'because this person surely didn't mean it that way and you're just overreacting'. The harassment is subtle, and for a reason: they know they can get away with it because they won't get called out on their behaviour.When I discuss gender equality, I always give my own long term relationship as how it should be. I have always refused to call myself feminist, and much more prefer the term egalitarian, as does my SO. The battle against sexism is - like you also said - not men against women, but men and women against the problem. We have a deal: it's my responsibility in society - as a female - to address sexism against men when I come across it (typically in my female based social circles), while it's *his* job - as a male - to address sexism against women in his circles.The problem is: a sexist man will by very definition never accept being called out for being sexist by a woman, but he will notice it when men start calling him out. Vice versa for women. We need both sexes on the same team if we want to root out sexism all together.So that's my request to you as a guy (and to all the others who feel the same): *please* be conscious about sexism against women and call men out on their sexist behaviour when you see it happening, because I know you face the same (in different shapes and forms) and I will call out other women when they do the same.|||I'm an only child.

I liked playing with radio controlled cars, building small robots, I loved metal music and was very much into goth subculture when I was a teen.Never did my dad tell me to be any different than the person I am. He built robots with me. He spent hours going out shopping with me while I tried figuring out my own individuality through dressing goth. When I wanted to take advanced mathematics courses in high school so I could get into an university engineering program but my school was throwing a fit because of fucked up sexism, he turned into a tiger dad and fought for me like no other until the school relented. The message this gave me was: what you want and who you are are important and worth fighting for, don't give a crap about what anybody else might say or think, because you are loved for who you are, not who you pretend to be.My dad's support of *me* as a person is the major reason why I grew up to be a hyper self-assured and confident young woman. My dad's love and support made me love and value myself, something which in today's world is really difficult for young women.|||Dear OP, I have removed your post as per rule #2 (cover pages are not allowed on r/bujo). |||Also, for many European countries, considering OP doesn't have a college degree: how many AP courses did you take in high school (most require like 4-5 of them as a hard entry requirement for universities).|||I've been doing crazy study load semesters for quite some time now, and my trick is to study in such a way in which you only work through any material once. I simply don't have time to spend more time on it.Read it once superficially, read it in depth and take notes one time more, don't ever open your book/slides/etc again, because your notes should be enough.I always read the material before class. I carry a basic oxford spiral bound A5 with me at all times, and all ugly notes and scribbles go into that notebook. During the lecture: focus. Dont try to make nice notes, because  it takes away from your focus from the lecture and again, you only get one shot at it because of time constraints. A home I have a set of separete notebooks, one for each class to take proper notes in. After the lecture I go through the material and my rough and ugly notes again, do deep reading and studying, and make my proper notes and summaries in that separate notebook by hand. When the exam comes around, I only have to review my notes. In my experience, I experience the heaviest work load when the course is around 40-70 percent done (like reaching 80 hours a week of active studying heavy). The last quarter + the exams themselves is quite a relaxt period of time and I barely if ever experience exam stress despite the study load.|||Ok, if you are coming over the Netherlands, better learn one thing really quick: our society is build on the concept 'find your own information'. Apparently, this is totally not normal in a more international context, but it is for us. This means that you actively need to reach out to get the information you need, because you will only be spoon fed the most basic info (which usually includes; who to contact for *more* info). It will definitely be freely given by anyone you ask, or you get a reference to whom you should ask your question, but you need to ask so you can get the info that's specific for *you*. So short answer is: go ask admissions or the study adviser. Anyway, is it a bachelor degree? Depending on which degree, you might have a chance here, because many bachelor degrees have two starting dates: 1st of Sept and 1st of Feb. Practically all masters have those two starting dates as well, while some still have monthly starting dates and some only one in September (both cases are pretty rare though).|||Mod note: a bunch of annoying spelling bot comments were removed and the bots banned from the sub. Thanks to the user for reporting them. |||As someone who actually keeps notes like these: be aware that *no one* makes pretty notes like in the picture straight away when sitting through a lecture. This is a product of a learning process, not a note taking process itself. You might want to look into getting a nice binder and buying high quality loose dotted paper. Sooo much easier for (re)organizing your notes or adapting notes later in the course.|||My gym only has mat classes. We have a major student run sport center where students (which I still am) and staff of my city's university and colleges can get a membership for 60 bucks/year and get access to all classes and the olympic pool. All instructors are paid professionals, but pilates isn't big enough (only about 5 classes per week or so) for dedicated reformer rooms. |||I don't know you, and I don't know your story. The reason why I wrote this sentence specifically, was not only because of your career related question. My long term SO is finally pulling out of his depression, and he has major self esteem issues because of it, thinking he is a failure, etc etc. However. He worked *very* hard to recover, and from my perspective as someone close to him, yet outside of his own head, I have seen him grow *a lot* in terms of maturity, mental stability and strength, and simply character. Although I of course would never wish a depression on anyone, he *has* become a better person because of his dedication to fighting and 'beating' it. He has learned a lot about himself as well in the process (although he may not be consciously realizing it just now). Those years were not wasted. And those years are not necessarily something to be embarrased about. Find an angle from which you can see worth in what you went through, and you'll have a much easier time answering your career related question as wel.|||You have 5 minutes. If you talk about 'your travels' you will have absolutely nothing memorable to tell, because it will be a lame, generic story. Pick something more specific from those travels, something that really had an impact on you as a person.Some totally random example:You could give a short overview of how you saw how poverty affected local communities in country X, and what the impact of given women micro-loans to build businesses meant for those communities. This could be a 3 slide presentation: 1. Show 1-2 pictures that frame the context of your travel experience.2. Something about the stories of female entrepreneurs backed by micro-loans.3. A slide on how it influenced your world view, and how that made you decide to run a yearly sponsored marathon to raise money for an NGO that provides these micro-loans.You're telling a story, and the example above is quite heavy and serious.. This should fit the position and role you are applying to. It should also fit you as a person. If you want something light hearted instead, it could be something like:You absolutely fell in love with Japanese food, and went on to do a cooking course. Make it funny by telling how you totally fucked up a dish you tried to make for your family and how they awkwardly avoided eating your dish. But, you persevered, and continued trying and last Christmas, even your super conservative Grandma who doesn't like anything but steak and potatoes liked your miso soup. Your next goal: learn how to cook traditional Chinese food, as you recently finished Sichuan province and found out you really like spicy food.|||Dear /u/pitter_paddy, your post has been removed as per rule 2: all content on the sub must be productivity related.|||Hi Nikki! I'm not in any way a professional web designer, but I've built my fair share of websites in the past for friends and the organizations I volunteer for. Like you said, you need a clean and minimalist website. Ideally something that is easy enough to manage on your own in terms of uploading new blog posts and adding/changing pictures, making sure it won't be too taxing on your energy levels to deal with the website. You already own your domain name I see, does this also include hosting? I think a (self-hosted) WordPress based website with an easy to use and intuitive template would be best for your needs. I'm really busy right now, but based on how things are looking, I should have time in November to at least get a decent looking and functional website up and running and transfer all current content to the new website. I might not be 100% perfect, but definitely an upgrade from what it is now. Feel free to PM me if you're interest, if you want, I can also send you some links to the websites I've built in the past. |||I can get a serious confidence boost out of how I dress. If I look perfect, someone that gives me an extra energy boost that can suddenly make everything else seem less daunting or stressful. I do like experimenting with fashion and style in general, so it's also something that's simply fun for me to do. With regard to daily ritual: if you feel down and stressed, it can be daunting to put together an amazing outfit on a moments notice. To tackle this, I have two wardrobes. One is for storing my clothes, and in the other, I have at any given time 15-25 ready to wear outfits (clean, ironed and accessorized) on clothes hangers which I can just pick and put on. I make sure to have a diversity of outfits ready: super formal to super casual, some with pants, some with skirts, some black and white, some super colorful etc. This way I can still choose to pick and outfit that matches my mood or intent that day, without having to stress about what I'm actually going to wear. Oh also: I have some high quality headphones that go with me everywhere. On my way to work, I can them to have some time alone (despite being surrounded by people) and either use music to relax or get myself pumped up. |||Your answer is similar to my point of view in life. I have three goals (in order of how much I struggle with each): be healthy and physically strong, intellectually challenge, emotional well-being. Like you, these are the topics on which I push myself, just to see how far I can get. However, all of these are extremely intrinsic goals, so success is defined by nothing else but my *personal* opinion on whether or not I am succeeding. I think this is what most ENTJs experience to be honest, and we communicate it by 'being successful is my goal in life'. But we do a seriously a crap job at communicating what we actually mean. We don't mean 'the societal equivalent of success' even if our goals align with what society thinks equates success. It's not about being judged by society (which is what other people would read into that sentence), it about judging yourself and being happy and content with your own life. That's also why I asked the question 'how does success equate to value?'. Because to me, it doesn't. Being (my own definition of) successful makes *life worth living* for me, but what does that say about my worth or the worth of my actions on this world? Not much in my opinion (I'm a bit of a nihilist anyway).|||I think many of the responses sound rude because of translation error. Although a lot of Dutch people speak English, they definitely aren't fluent ('Dunglish'). I can kinda guess what Dutch phrasing these people had in mind when answering you, which sound fine in Dutch, but rude in English if you translate them word by word like many Dutchies do. The bureaucratic attitude of 'this is the process, don't disrupt it' combined with the language barrier can definitely make it sound hostile even. If you don't mind me asking, what would you consider 'generally inefficient' regarding for example the university courses? (If you're fed up with me, that's fine, I just honestly find this stuff fascinating. I also don't see these things myself, because as a Dutchie, I'm part of the same system.)|||Any chance you can find PM jobs with companies that are related to your field (even if the project itself isn't)? Your previous experience can definitely set you apart and be valuable on which non of the youngsters can outcompete you, but you'll need to find a crowd that sees the value of it to begin with.|||Why don't you consider the University of Groningen? They have an English med undergrad programme, during which internationals get intensive Dutch language classes (which is no joke, because it's on top of your regular heavy med course load) which prepares you for entry into the Dutch graduate programme. This programme was developed specifically for students in situations like yours anyway.Oh, and if you didn't know already: the Dutch/European system is very different to the US college system. You can only get into a graduate program if you have a bachelor in a closely related field. That means you could do a chemistry graduate programme based on either a chemistry undergrad diploma and probably a molecular biology undergrad diploma, but not with a biology diploma. The same goes for med school, with the exception that nursing is not a university level education in the Netherlands (rather high level vocational education), so you'd might find that you can't start in med grad school with nursing or anything else *but* a med bachelor degree.|||Something they say on r/relationships: stop JADEing. JADE stands for justify, argue, defend or explain. And you aren't required to do any if those to make your point known. You really just need to tell this guy: I said no, I will not ride your bike, this topic is not up for discussion, stop bringing it up. And when he starts pestering about why, you simply reply with: I simply won't, drop the subject.We women are taught to continuously justify our choices. In cases like these, we need to unlearn that behaviour.|||No one is born a great communicator. It's good to realize that many of the people who are 'naturally' good communicators, typically have had one or two parents that are great communicators as well.. This means that these teenagers (when these skills really start to show) have had a decade in which they listened, observed, and learned to how to speak in such manners from their parents. It's really learned behaviour. So: find a way to learn! I recommend trying to find *public* speaking or debating courses and the like. Public speaking will teach you a lot of how to conduct *yourself*, which is something that - once you figure it out - can really easily translate into picking up on subtle communications of others.  |||This is definitely the other side of the coin. I'm glad you did get diagnosed in the end, it must be hard to know something is wrong and not being believed by those who have to power to actually help... Reading back my comment, it could come across as rather harsh. It was definitely not my intention to discredit your personal health experiences, if it came across as such, I do apologize. I simply came across many, *many* obese individuals who hid behind the 'it's not my fault, I can't do anything about it' argument without actually having conditions that warrant that attitude (while actively dragging down others with them) that I tend to react negatively when it comes up. |||All comments are focusing on the hair thing only. I mean, the hair is one thing. His tone is awful, but depending on his behaviour in general, it just *might* be him being taken off guard. I remember when my boyfriend for example came home one night after hanging out with friends, who shaved his head in a half drunken, half funny 'yolo' moment. I am usually very calm, but I lost it, because I was so taking aback by the suddenness of it all and I really, *really* did not like the look at all (my guy looked like a frikin skinhead for fucks sake). I composed myself soon after and apologized, but still, I can imagine his response being a one off thing.Anyway, I am actually curious about something else you wrote, because it's way more telling than this single incident:What does 'he does his best' and 'work with me' mean in this sentence? |||Just because I feel it needs repeating: by law, universities are not allowed to own or manage their own housing. The university makes 'friendly agreements' with housing agencies, but is in no way responsible (again: by law, they can't) to provide housing. The ministry of education has explicitly separated the educational function of a university with the need for housing and other organizational functions. On top of that, any EU student with the right qualification simply cannot be turned away, because those same laws compel the universities to accept any NL/EU student that applies when they meet entry requirements. Sure they might chose to do less marketing in foreign countries, but that would be one less drop in the bucket and not a real solution.As shit as the situation is: it is not the university's faults. It's the governmental laws and system that needs change to address this problem.|||You can take out 4 percent of your capital each year and have a very high probability of the principle never becoming less over the course of your lifetime, as average long term (historical) market growth is more than that 4 percent. I don't live in the US, but in a EU country with socialized healthcare. So healthcare isn't a problem in my case luckily. 1MM would give you a yearly 'income' of about 40k. In my country, modal household income is 32k, meaning that a 40k income puts you well within the 'well off' range of incomes. Sure, in the US, you'll need to account for healthcare, but even in the US there are plenty of LCOL places where 40k will give you a very comfortable life with money to spare.|||This is actually something most countries with socialized healthcare do. The government sets a yearly quota on students who can enter med school. But this is done to ensure there isn't a surplus on doctors, as of course, education typically costs next to nothing in these countries as well, meaning there is massive interest (at least far more interest than market demand) to become a doctor. |||I agree, this does not sound like Te dom at all.. especially the need to rely on external frameworks in an effort to organize yourself and your thinking..  a typically Te Dom would stomp on any and all existing frameworks and synthesize their own bigger picture which they would put their faith in and rely on, whether others in their environment recognize the validity of their own framework or not. Especially because OP doesn't recognize *any* Ni... when you look at ENTJ children/teens that run solely on their dominant Te, they are quite easy to spot (and not necessary in a good way). OP doesn't come across as a 13 year old Te bulldozer either.|||Life is about opting in, not about opting out. Any place can be lonely if you don't actively work on making friendships and putting yourself in a position that allows yourself to make friends. This has nothing to do with being an international or not, it's just a fact of life. Recently, the uni newspaper ran an article series on loneliness among students. They interviewed some (Dutch) students, and the stories are quite consistant: I missed to boat to make friends when I started studying and there were a bunch of opportunities to do so, how everybody is settled in with their friends and I don't know what to do or how to get a a foot in the door, it scares me to actually have to put myself out there.That being said, there is plenty to do in Groningen with low participation thresholds (sports clubs, associations, parties, etc). Whether you will attend Groningen or any other place: if you want to be sure not to be lonely, say yes to opportunities to meet people, especially in the first months after you arrive. |||Wear high quality shoes (which usually results in higher prices as well, sadly)... I wear heels 80-90% of the time ever since my teenage years, I love heels, but I learned that quality is way more important than people realize. I had a very serious ankle injury some years ago, resulting in half a dozen surgeries on my ankle. With a fucked up joint like that, I became very aware of how bad low quality shoes are for your joints. I had to find brands that work for my feet, but now that I've done so, heels are actually more confortable on my broken ankle, as the heel actually helps stabilize my joint with my specific injury. I personally like the brand Pikolinos a lot, as well as Panana Jacks (though less than Pikolinos). They are not cheap, but also not overly expensive. I usually get my shoes in sale, and they last me a good 3 years of (very) intensive wear, as I only own a few pairs of shoes anyway.Edit with addition to the above: I seriously, *seriously* dislike the general style of those brands... especially Pikolinos... frankly, I think their shoes are ugly. Yet, I keep hoping season in, season out, that they just produce a single nice pair of shoes that actually look nice. And sometimes they do! Anyway, I hope this helps to frame how **important** quality shoes are for your body, especially when wearing heels. |||Another one: no gap between the arch of your foot and the shoe. Your foot needs that arch to be stable to ensure pressure is actually properly dispersed over the foot. This is often an issue for people like me with relatively high archs.|||I don't. Once it starts to become warm enough, I don't wear a coat anymore, and the wind provides a nice breeze through my clothing to cool me down. Sure, if it's high temperature (and high humidity as it often is in Dutch summer) you should take care to leave on time so you don't have to race to get on work on time. On that case, yes, you'd sweat. But that also holds for winter. Actually, like I said on my post, I have about 5 coats which I alternate. I have more sweat issues related to choosing the wrong coat for the day than actually the biking itself. |||I have developed one heck of a neckbeard radar. Engineering has way too many men who through their upbringing, social isolation, and lack of female role models in their lives truly believe women owe them. Luckily, I have a quite a dominant personality, and when my neckbeard radar goes off, I'll make sure to keep that dominant stance right in the forefront. I'm usually not too impressed by these  men, and they seriously cannot deal with a dominant female. I simply make sure my work (both raw output as well as professionalism and company fit) is leagues ahead of their game. It's a standoff I won't let them win.Anyway, luckily, there are *loads* of guys who aren't sexist shitbags. I befriend them really quickly, and stick close to the more dominant vocal types who refuse to take bullshit, just like me. It shouldn't be necessary, but these male allies give a lot of social safety. And they are super fun! These are the guys I would definitely feel comfortable asking out to go to a bar after work with friendship being implied, because I know they are decent people and respectful of my boundaries.|||They have a website (melem.com) which you could probably use Google translate on. I use the product that's sold in the original little silver tin.I'm sure there are a bunch of other lanolin based products though which could be good for you.

A love like yours will stay with you all your life. You'll love her all your life. Maybe one day you'll find someone else, but doesn't mean you'll stop loving her. Finding a new person who is amazing and perfecf, doesn't mean she'll become anything less than amazing and perfect. She shaped you, became part of you, made you a better man. That's not something you'd ever want to move on from.Telling you to move on is honestly a cruel thing to say. |||I was at my GP office a week or two ago and I asked exactly this question: 'I have had all my childhood vaccination, is there any reason to retake them?' My doctors answer was no.|||Childcare often requires a specific childcare/pedagogy degree in the Netherlands, so that could work against you, however, you have quite a lot of actual experience, which might pull you through instead! I think your main concern should be the language. Focus on the language as much as you can, as you will simply not be hired for childcare related jobs without. You need to get your language skills to a proper B2 level, but preferably a C1 level. Your second priority should be getting a masters degree. As stupid as it might be, there simply is not a market for academically trained people with only bachelor degrees, due to some history of how the Dutch educational system worked before the bachelor/master structure was introduced. The fact that you already had some sort of exchange to a Dutch university is quite a strong indicator your bachelor degree will be recognized in the Netherlands as actually being of academic quality (which not all college/university diplomas from the US are!), which is great news. I think you do need to accept that reality will be that it might very well be difficult to find a job for you at this stage, and you might be stuck with part time jobs that won't earn you a lot of money for the time being. This means your partner should be in a position to support both of you for large parts, while you are saving your income to pay of your US loans and save for a masters degree.|||My advice to male students is very simply: ask your female peers about their experiences with gender bias and discrimination. Actually *listen* to what they have to say, without immediately jumping to defend yourself or your gender. The fact that you care enough to ask, will most likely mean you are not 'one of them', so there is no need for you personally to justify this behaviour. You are an individual person. We 'women' are not out on hating or blaming you 'men'. Just *listen* to the unique experiences on this specific subject of these individuals that happen to be female. Many of the negative experiences women deal with during their student years is social exclusion, which is rather subtle and often deals with things such as inappropriate 'jokes' and banter. If you are a man who wants to help further gender equality, be aware of these social processes, and you as a *man* (or better: male individual) should call out other male individuals when they are being sexist or misogynist, as especially at younger ages, men will not accept being called out by women on their behaviour, but they usually do (subconsciously) care about the opinion of their male peers, because these opinions influence their social status, considering STEM is a male dominated field.To my fellow women: the same goes for us. I noticed that within STEM, women tend to unknowingly pick up some of these toxic behaviour as well due to it being so 'normal' in our direct, daily environments, either by joining in the misogynistic behaviours *or* by being sexist towards men in an fucked up effort to somehow compensate. We women should call out other women when we notice this happening, just like men should call out other men. This is also the reason why I do not call myself a feminist, but rather egalitarian. It is not *only* about progressing women's right and privilege, but rather about creating a future society that is truly gender equal.|||Why is getting citizenship such a big deal to you (honest question)? Why isn't permanent residency status enough? |||Growing up, going through these feelings, I always thought I wanted to be with someone who's just like me. I figured, we'd be the typical power couple, with amazing careers, lots of independence, it would just work naturally, no drama, and the relationship would just be *efficient*. I ended up with a man who is very unlike me in his ways of thinking, doing and ambitions, but we agree on all major life goal, *and* he somehow ( seriously, i don't know how ) understand *me* and who I am. He respects all my diffocult, shitty sides and sees were I'm coming from while even loving me because of it. I'm glad I ended up with him, don't get me wrong, the relationship is *not* easy and efficient, but that's a good thing because it forced me to grow as a person and I'm better for it. I realized that in the end, a relationship isn't supposed to be easy, it's really hard work to get it right, whoever you're with.My point: you can't find someone while running a checklist. Accept that at this moment, you can't know what kind of person would be good for you. Get those major life topics (politics, kids, marriage) on the same page, and just take things as they come to just *experience* what that relationship does to you as a person.|||God, this is heart breaking... your comment also reminded me of my current relationship to my INTP guy. There is *always* something to talk about and the conversations are always somehow impossibly good and satisfying. He has had his bouts with depression and suicidal ideation. Sometimes it scares the shit when the train of thought gets out of control and is making me think of what would happen if I'd lose him. I'll make sure to give him some extra hugs tonight. |||By the way, I actually did some courses on tech/engineering entrepreneurship. One of the major contributing factors for entrepreneurial activity is knowledge of and experience in the fields they are operating. These factors are positively moderating both idea generation and successful execution of those ideas. An engineer can much more easily become a successful entrepreneur in engineering/tech fields if they have the right character fit and determination needed for the job, while a business major will have a far harder time due to not having the industry knowledge and expertise. If you know you want to be an entrepreneur in tech/engineering, definitely keep up with your engineering studies.  |||Ok, that's good!

I do express my gratitude pretty openly to people who completed services to me... by saying 'thank you very much!'. That same gratitude is expressed by being a return customer and continue to pay them for their service. That's probably the biggest compliment I could possibly give right?Again, it's just honestly confusion for me because to me, it's absolutely bonkers and I've always had trouble understanding why it's so ingrained in your culture.|||Ugh.. this brought me back to a really bad place in my head. In my early teens, I got struck down really often by people telling me I was being 'iamverysmart' when I expressed how I felt out of place due to my intelligence. I got my ideas, thoughts and feelings invalidated because of it, as I was just a 'silly teen' with too big of an ego. It made me shut up, keep to myself and not show too much of myself. The thing is: I was actually right about my feelings back then. I am incredibly intellectually gifted, which came with a *very* specific set of psychological problems which were not recognized or acknowledged, leading to quite serious issues in my emotional development. I'm still coping with the consequences and working through my issues through specialized therapy.Although no one's to blame, I really resent how I wasn't given proper psychological guidance growing up, thinking maybe some of my current issues could have been prevented. This part of your comment made me feel pretty annoyed. Yes, maybe OP is just your typical teen with too big of an ego... but maybe she's not, in which case these kind of comments can be quite damaging. |||.. God, this hit a nerve. My mother is an ESFJ. Our relationship is... difficult. By now, I feel like I have a proper grip on how to *deal with* ESFJ and have pleasant interactions with people from this type (mostly, I learned how to mirror behaviour that seems to please the ESFJ type), simply through sheer exposure to this type... but I will *never*, *ever* be able to understand them. |||This is seriously awesome. I've been telling people that besides heritage I also wanted my second nationality because of increased mobility and everyone told me not to bother because I already had a EU passport which everyone thinks covers everything.

Usually, I only carry one bag with me wherever I go, so the contents are very much optimized already for my day to day life. However, I tend to forget stuff when I get out of my daily routine. I'm going to get some extra spare electronics/toiletries to make these kits. For last minute or short travels, this would come in handy.|||Awesome! I'm so happy for you! I'm assuming you changed your bio to give a more... balanced? insight into your personality. There's s major benefit in this approach as well: the women who are attracted to these kind of men are typically more balanced themselves which means less drama. Life's too short for bullshit drama. I'm super curious about what you put in your bio though.. maybe you could send me a PM with your (anonymous) bio to satisfy my curiosity? Obviously if you don't want to, that's 100% fine with me as well!|||It will matter because at least in the Netherlands, you won't be competitive with just a bachelor as the standard for a SCM career is a masters. At the same time, MBAs are not much of a thing here (because again, everybody already has masters degrees), and only matters for very specific careers tracks (consultancy, executive management) and in these careers, the MBA needs to be world class (Ivy, INSEAD, LBS, etc) to matter. |||You should start looking for housing companies online and approach them directly to ask what your options are and whether they are willing to rent to you. That would be your best bet. Then, if one or two would agree to rent to you, you need to keep a close eye on their offerings from around april onward and if you find something that becomes available from summer, apply for it, and if necessary, prepare to pay a month of extra rent even if you are not yet in Groningen to secure the apartment.|||Ok, that should be fine. We have two types of higher education in the netherlands: applied sciences (called HBO, 'higher vocational education') and academic (called WO, 'scientific education'). Both offer chemistry degrees. Typically, HBO *only* offers bachelor degrees, while WO offers both bachelor and master degrees. However, especially in chemistry, it is very unlikely to 'just' have a WO bachelor degree and if you want to do WO type of chemistry jobs, you'll **need** a masters or even a PhD. Anyway, the type of job you're describing definitely fits the HBO type of chemistry career track, so just your bachelors would be fine. I agree that for your career a (WO) masters degree will likely not add anything to your job prospects. You'll be employable by universities and academic hospitals, but, jobs are hard to come by in this sector. I think you should probably also consider the chemical industry, at least for a first job. Chemical industry is mostly located in several 'hubs' across the country. You should research this, as well as the cities that have major academic hospitals (and thus also universities) and figure out what would be a good location for both of you based on this.About your salary: 40k (before tax) seems about right for a HBO chemist in *industry* **with** experience. Most research institutions are public and have set salary scales which are lower than industry. I would expect a HBO chemistry technician with about 5-10 years experience to quite comfortably hit 40k, but a recent graduate would most likely be more at the level of 30k. That being said: it's still a really good salary. Sure, net income will be lower, but especially if you can both earn ~30k, you'll very much live a *very* comfortable life (definitely upper middle class).|||Mijn pa is management controller. Hij was degene die al op m'n 16de zei van: hey, het is jouw lening, maar je moet hier maar eens over nadenken want het kan een goed idee voor je zijn. Mijn moeder is volledig financieel analfabeet, dus ik praat met haar uberhaupt nooit over financien.Verder doe ik een betastudie waar ik openlijk over deze constructie praat. Er is een groep die hetzelfde doet, een groep die het niet doet uit risicooverweging (angst voor schuld) en een groep die het niet doet uit moreel perspectief. Dat gezegdhebbende, ik heb er nooit sociale backlash door gekregen.Wat ik je wel wil meegeven: thuis wonen bespaart je heel erg veel geld, maar in de fase van je leven waar je nu in zit is zelfontwikkeling erg belangrijk. Mijn ouders woonde in dezelfde stad waar ik studeer, maar ben in mijn tweede jaar alsnog op mezelf gaan wonen. Ja het is duur, maar het was ontzettend goed geinvesteerd geld omdat ik er als persoon beter door ben geworden.|||Any chance you're American? I notice these behaviours from the Americans in my study programme as well: the need for continuous, insincere bullshit because God forbid we acknowledge not everything is 100% positive in life.

The thing is, both can be tackled separately. One can still become fat when eating only perfectly healthy food, simply by eating *too* much. Being overweight is due to one reason only: you are eating more calories than you are using. Losing weight is also only due to one thing: you are eating less calories than you are using. This means that your husband can still tackle his weight loss, even if he isn't willing to change the *type* of food he likes to eat. You could in all seriousness eat only Snickers all day every day, and still lose weight, provided you are eating at a caloric deficiency. Anyway, that would be my approach: let him eat whatever the fuck he wants, but he simply needs to eat at a caloric deficiency by tracking all his calories. That way, he can chose to spend his daily calories on beer, no problem, but it also means something else has to give, and he has to decide what that might be. He's a grown up and he needs to be the one to take control of his own life and make decisions regarding his own life. That's not something you can do for him.|||The interesting thing about this is that in each case, you'd need to look at how both national laws interact. Germany seems to have an automatic loss of citizenship clause, *except* for EU (and Switzerland) member states. The Netherlands doesn't have that exception, and simply states you loose your Dutch citizenship upon naturalisation. That means if you are German, married to a Dutch citizen, and naturalize as a Dutch citizen, you will retain both Nationalities. But if you are Dutch, and you naturalize as a German citizen, you automatically loose your Dutch citizenship. And if you are citizenship of EU country X who also has automatic citizenship loss upon naturalisation laws like the Netherlands, and you are married to a Dutch citizen, and naturalize as a Dutch citizen, you might not be required by Dutch law to renounce your former citizenship, but by the laws of your country of origin, you would anyway due to naturalizing as a Dutch citizen.|||I STRONGLY recommend against starting another sub. It's only been a month. And I get that it feels long, but it isn't. When I took over on my sub (which is quite a big bigger than this one) after some sub drama, I realised change takes time.. I'm now 4 months further down that road and still working on basics. Shit takes time when it comes to moderations.. There was a spin off in my case as well, which was resolved in the end, but could have become ugly if the drama did drag on.Having a spin off at this point can seriously fracture the community which is not beneficial to anyone. Be patient. Do it right. The option of a spin off can always be considered at a later point in time when u/canyoustop actually PROOFS to be unresponsive and unwilling. And if that happens, again, take it slow and do this spin off the right way: organized and systematically (and again, not out of sub drama frustration).|||Why is it not a long term solution? I had this discussion with my GP some weeks ago related to early menopause (I'm mid 20s now, my mother went into menopause early 30s) and she said that I could stay on BC long term if I wanted (as in: the next decade or 2). She even mentioned it might be a good idea as the extra hormones would probably reduce any menopause syndromes. She said side effects such as thrombosis were mostly an issue if you would stop and restart your BC all the time, as the massive hormone shift was what caused the risk of side effects, but if you took it continuously, the risk of thrombosis went down.|||Dear u/tattoopuppy, your post has been removed as per rule 2: cover pages are not allowed on r/bujo.

The Netherlands is very much a services market and having a  highly educated population adds to market growth of the country. A stronger market with lot of  highly paid jobs means more taxes from both businesses and individuals, which greatly offsets the costs of losing out on the repayment.|||When I'm with my SO, it's amazing. He thinks I'm absolutely gorgeous and the most amazing woman in the world. And he makes me feel as such. It makes me honestly feel like I'm Wonder Woman on a daily basis, in a way I don't think other types can. My SO (an INTP) often tells me that the thing he appreciates most of my character is how I simultaneously push him to achieve new things outside of his comfort zone, while also giving him the freedom to make his own decisions. I - as a person - provide something in our relationship that's a solid base from which he can build and explore. I think this is something extremely valuable ENTJ women in general can offer, as we are often socialized because of our gender to be more sensitive to other's needs and emotions. We just see 'taking care of' in a different way compared to the ISFJs you mentioned.|||Bingo.

Ik vraag me dan af in hoeverre het simuleren van een portfolio van vlak na de industriële revolutie nog relevant is voor vandaag. Hoe zouden de uitkomsten veranderen als je de wereldoorlogen en alles wat daarvoor kwam weg laat en alleen simuleert vanaf ~1950. Gevalletje: mochten we wel WW3 meemaken en daarop volgende marktdisruptie, dan geldt toch 'all bets are off' en ga ik belangrijkere vragen aan mijn hoofd hebben dan early retirement.

The opportunities to use your art and apply it to murals, fabrics, even use products (phonecases for example) gives so much more opportunity than simply selling prints.My mum's an interior designer. About 15-20 years ago she realized there was potential in this scene of art inspired products. She got one of her professional artist friends (expressionist acrylic paiter, already an artist making a living out of her art) to have some of her pieces professionally photographed and digitized. She got a company to make an exclusive one -off series of carpets based on her art. She got a high-end furniture store to sell the carpets for *a lot* of money and they sold pretty quick, each of them taking a cut.Obviously, when you're a *digital* artists, you can make art with these kind of product use cases already in mind.|||You've been awesome at answering all my questions, despite me asking about makeup on a random /r/gif sub!

In the Netherlands, the government offers practically all citizens access to good funding opportunities, so there is very little need for scholarships among the population. From my experience, most people from abroad who come over with scholarships do so with scholarships from their country of origin. Many countries have scholarship schemes that pay for foreign education on the condition the student returns to the country for x years for example. Don't count on comprehensive generic Dutch scholarship schemes to be available, outside of those handful of programs that have specific funding for their own students (few and far in between).|||I wish I could run.

My relationship is very much solid and healthy, but I think it's important to keep repeating the need for BOB in abuse situations, because it sadly is very common and awareness is life saving. Also: even though my relationship is not abusive, there is always the risk of your SO (male *or* female) suddenly experiencing a full psychological break down.

It was really silly, but profound. I've been under a lot of stress while taking care of my SO who's is going through long term illness. Too much to go into now. I took a break from everything to avoid a burnout and am getting back in the saddle. I'm not in the best place yet, so everything is giving me some compounding anxiety right now. Last week was tough. One day, just everything was going wrong. I had a workout class scheduled which was the one thing I was looking forward to all week. I was running late and had to stress to make it on time. My gym is typically open without any checkpoints. But when I got to the place, I realized I forgot my gym card and they happen to have a checkpoint set up. I couldn't get in.I walked outside. Sat on a bench in the out in the snow just.. being empty. At one point I got myself home and got in the shower. I sat down on the ground and just cried and cried and cried. My SO kept me company.

That being said, having experienced harsher and harsher weather conditions that already push my country's (extremely well funded and advanced) infrastructure to its limits, I don't think it's pessimistic at all to prepare for extreme weather which may cause you to not have access to grocery stores, running water, and/or electricity.

My most expensive books were maybe 80 euros, most are 40-50, and these are prices for new copies. You can get them second hand for way cheaper. I would suggest only buying the books at full price for the first couple of courses you'll start in september, and buy the others as you go. Once you have a network going on, you're more likely to find good deals. If you wanna have a look at typical prices, go to bol.com which is kinda like the Dutch Amazon equivalent. I also often order my books from Amazon.de (German amazon) as they have free delivery on books to the Netherlands and are usually a bit cheaper than Bol.|||I had this discussion with my GP. My mum got her menopause extremely early, and although I have no desire for children (and thus don't give a fuck about my fertility) I did not like the thought of what menopause would do to my body, especially at a young age.My GP simply told me to stay on my hormonal BC and with a bit of luck, the hormones would counteract any of the physical issues related to menopause due to a bit of hormone replacement. Big chance I might go through the process without noticing it at all.She also mentioned there is little modern science can do about *delaying* menopause as it's not just a function of the number of eggs women are born with but a function of genetics. There are however plenty of options in terms of freezing eggs etc. if biological children are wanted after menopause. |||Dear u/Shingoru, your post has been removed as per rule 3: Image posts **must** be accompanied by a comment from the OP in the comment section within **1 hour** of posting.

Of course, I don't actually do that, but I feel like it at times. Outwardly, this mostly shows in me becoming very snappy and sarcastic with the people I'm frustrated with, followed by me working extra hard to proof them wrong, and that no, fuck you, you are *not* doing this efficiently, and I'm going to proof it to you.The second is hatred, which doesn't happen often, but when it happens, it's deep and final. If I hate your guts, it's definitely a case of 'Hell hath no fury', and I will do everything I can to make you miserable, because fuck you, I hate you, and you deserve it. You would *never* know though, as it wouldn't show, and I'd make sure you'd never realize it's me fucking you over.In both cases, it's emotion over rationality, so I guess it's both cases of losing my temper, and I hate myself for letting it happen. It happens though every once in a while. And both are extreme, and I guess scary, but in very different ways. Working on myself to be a better person in the future.|||A lot of them do. Like any major production company that makes products which don't depend on branding then at the absolutely lowest price possible do. Take Philips for example. They produce a line of shaver products. Practically all components are made in China, except for one thing which is 100% EU produced: the razor blades themselves. Sure. They find copy cats of their products on the Chinese market, but although the look 100% the same, the critical component (the actual razor) can't be copied because that piece of tech is under lock down as a trade secret. |||I feel you on this one... I'm 5 years further down the road and Se is *still* difficult. I'm also in systems engineering by the way! Anyway. I was at a similar point, except that I was convinced that I was more of an INTJ than a ENTJ because I'm actually quite introverted and need a lot of alone time to decompress from social interaction. This was before I realized that social introversion has nothing to do with E/I in MBTI typing.My realization came about the same time I slowly moved into systems engineering. I realized that my mind sorts things 'out there in the world' and not 'inside my head'. My 'light bulb moments' were always linked to seeing, hearing, discussing something currently happening/being a reality. My Ni was used to connect all those individual experience 'in real life' and gain greater insight on how to improve systems 'in real life'. From a systems engineering perspective, it goes a bit like this:An INTJ would have a much more formalized internal framework of 'reality as an optimized system would look like x' and the INTJ would work to change reality to fit x. In this case, creating the vision of what x *should* be is their dominant Ni at work (supported by Te to make it viable).I go 'reality can be seen as a system currently organized as y, but could be improved by changing functions and interactions between subsystems to have the system organized as z instead' and act to make reality fit z. In my case, the iteration from system design y to design z is my dominant Te at work (supported by Ni for 'whole is greater than its parts' insight).|||No, I have KPRF.

The 200 to 400k range is something you'd see for C-level executives for NL headquarter companies (looking at smaller multinationals not.. Shell or whatever, which has a CEO compensation of several millions). The lower end of 'top salaries' say 100 to 150k is doable if you have the background and ambition, but those are senior level salaries, say, 15+ years of work experience.The mid tier management positions (director of a facility/major branch or two for example, but not a VP position of a region or the company as a whole) you're talking about would more likely be in the range of 60-90k a year (maybe less for non tech based industries) which are still really - and I mean *really* - good salaries for the Netherlands.|||I'm really doubt whether HSK6 is C1.. For one reason specifically: a key component to C1 is being able to write and talk about your field of expertise in an academic setting. Imagine the following scenarios for a person who just passed HSK6: Could a chemist write a bachelor thesis about novel, not done before reactions with ease? Could a technician write detailed reports on a mechanical failure meant to be read by other technicians? Could a student in international relations write an opinionated in-depth piece about the current state of collaborations between China and the EU, backed by scientific literature? I seriously doubt it...I think many people underestimate the HUGE gap between B2 and C1 ability. In my opinion and in my experience, it's the most difficult one to breach, as you go from being effective fluent in an informal setting, to fluent in a formal setting. |||Yes, that's exactly what I am saying.

Protection above SPF 50 can't properly be measured. We're talking about the difference between blocking 97% of radiation (SPF 30), 98% (SPF 50) and maybe 98.5-99% (SPF 75).There is a reason why in the EU it's illegal to market for sunscreen with claims that go beyond SPF 50.

The thing is, you can't really spin depression in itself to somehow be viewed as a positive thing, because.. well.. it isn't. Instead, maybe take some time to think about what you learned through dealing with depression. Did anything come from it that you can put into specific actions (STAR method all the way!). For example, a random made up story I just came up with to illustarte my point: if part of your depression treatment was to start volunteering somewhere, you can spin that part into a positive story about how you lost all passion for law because of the depression, but the volunteering got you back in touch with why you pursued law, as you found great satisfaction in helping others out, which gave you convinction to get back on track, start working on your bar, in the hopes of maybe someday doing pro deo work for the disenfranchised. |||I'm Europe based, so that might be different. What I would do in the case of a research internship at your uni: find a list of all staff members in the fields you are interested in. Pick a bunch of them who are preferably younger (assistant or associate level professors), as younger professors usually have a smaller sized group, which means these professors are usually closer to their researchers and will make it easier for a professor to decide to match you up with a PhD or post doc of their team, for something which is essentially outside of the curriculum (meaning you're asking for a favour). Read up some recent articles for each of these professors. When you email them, be precise about what topic in their team interests you, the amount of time you have available, and the kind of support and guidance you'd need from both the professor and a daily supervisor. End the email with a message like: if you are willing to accommodate me in your group over summer, I'll be happy to work out the details with whatever phd/postdoc supervisor you have in mind. - ending with a request to either forward your mail to the phd/postdoc, or to get their contact info send to you instead.Use the second paragraph of your email (assuming you use the first to introduce yourself and the goal as to which you are contacting this person) to express why their specific research interests you, maybe tell them about your ambitions (if they are academic) and how you'd like to get more experience to hopefully get further in a similar field as well. etc etc. Make sure you show them you've done your homework and researched their work. Show them you are actually contacting them because you want to be part of *their* group, not *a* group.It's much, *much* better to send out 2-4 honest requests, than to 'send out a million emails to multiple professors'. Seriously. |||Hmm, interesting. I've been thinking a lot about how I've been presenting myself in different situations..

Nee, je *hoeft* hem niet op te geven op het moment, maar het komt zo nu en dan toch steeds weer terug in politieke discussies dat ik het een heel reeel scenario vind dat een duo lening officieel bkr geregistreerd gaat worden en dan kom je er niet meer onderuit. Natuurlijk, je kunt nu alles lenen met het idee dat geld in je eerste huis te stoppen want lage rente, dan heb je daar geen last van, maar dat betekent dus dat je wsl niet dat geld kunt inzetten voor een eigen bedrijf én daarna alsnog een fatsoenlijke hypotheek kunt krijgen. Dit heeft gevolgen voor je lange termijn planning wat betreft je vermogensopbouw, maar bijvoorbeeld ook je woonopties in het land.|||Yeah, I definitely make sure I keep my weekends scheduled off as much as possible, also to allow for a buffer during peak load weeks. I life incredibly close to my uni, which makes all the difference in the world to me. I usually get up around 7, get myself ready and do some light reading. Off to uni at 8:45 until 17:00-17:30 either going to lectures or work meetings. I have a job at uni that has very few set working hours and allows for all the flexibility I need, as long as I can get the work done. Then I take a rest until about 20:00 to eat, game, watch tv or read, and study again until 23:00. I got to bed around 24:00-00:30, and rinse and repeat.Recounting my hours, I definitely do not reach 80 hours a week on average to be honest. Those are peak load weeks for me, which happens like once every 4-6 weeks during the academic year. 60 hours average is much closer to reality. |||If you get accepted to Groningen, it's nice to know that all internationals are granted free professionally taught Dutch language courses up to intermediate level and any advanced courses are not too expensive (maybe 100-200 euros per semester). If you start straight away in your first year, you can definitief become fluent in Dutch (say B2+ or even proper C1 level if you put in the effort).|||Right, this makes way more sense! Thanks for your comment.|||What kind of volunteering are you thinking about?|||I think this will highly depend on what you want from your career. If you want to stay in that specific niche field (are you an academic?), it might be very hard to find a job in your new area that will contribute to your long term career goals. The two-body problem in academia is very, *very* real. However, if you the ambition to direct your career into less specific directions, it might not matter that much if you step outside of your niche, as long as you have opportunities within the industry (at large) at your new location. You just need to get creative and think about what could be valuable skills and job titles for the job you see yourself having maybe 10-15 years from now. Random example to illustrate what I'm saying: if you are in some kind of hyper specific bird ecology field, and you are thinking of maybe taking up leadership roles in a major scientific NGO in that field later on in your career, you might look into governmental project management jobs at your new place that focus on *any* nature conservation topic in your new area. No, it's not your niche, but it will provide you with a set of interesting new skills that will be valuable for your long term goal.All of that being said: I think it's great you and your SO are being a team on this. It can be tough both wanting to build your careers. If your SO moved for your career's sake, it makes sense to return the favor. As long as you the two of you keep working together and are moving forward together, I'm sure this move will also work out for your and your career. Maybe not as optimally as it would be if you had only your career to consider, but you will definitely make massive strides forward for the two of you as a unit.|||Can you give some examples of 'being treated like an idiot'? I'm really just curious whether about the intercultural experience of this feeling you're describing.. whether what you consider 'being treated like an idiot' would be considered just normal behaviour by us or not.|||Yes, another reason (next to seeing our parents go through the recessions) that pushed me to go the extreme lengths to make sure I will stay competitive when maybe another recession hits. I'm still ~1 year out for my graduation... the recent recession talks have me quite worried to be honest. Then again, I know I have a competitive resume even among the top-end of high achieving graduates. I'm really happy I put in the effort all those years.|||B2 as a starting point before coming over is *perfect*. Usually B2 is considered a requirement for getting citizenship, enter universities, etc.. but from my experience, it's just a bit lower than you'd like if you'd want to do your job in those languages. Anyway, these transnational (governmental) institutions in Europe: yes, their main working language is English, **but** in practice, they will require sufficient language skills. Mainly because the official EU languages are English, German, and French (equally) and also because these transnational institutions need to deal with a lot of national institutions that will mostly work in their native languages. Having a diverse set of employees able to use a variety of languages is not only an asset, but a necessity. Also: practically all children that end up getting higher education have had extensive language education during high school, meaning it is also not necessarily unrealistic to ask for proficiency in multiple languages. My opinion: do it, but choose your location strategically that will allow you to network like crazy with these institutions. Being close to London, Brussels, Munich, etc. will work in your favour. |||All of the above, and adding having experienced long term illness.|||As an ENTJ, I really couldn't care less about the success of others, because my measure of success is intrinsic, opposed to extrinsic: could *I* have been better, stronger, faster in my course of action? No? Great, that means I succeeded. No point in looking at others, because that doesn't influence whether *I* could have succeeded more.So, if you want to defeat an ENTJ, frustrate that process. Death by a thousand small inefficiencies...Slash a certain car wire so the car doesn't start in the morning every month or so (wasting your ENTJs time to go to the car dealer and get it fixed). Steal their pens and notebooks from the office. Make sure they get hit by every single flu wave. 'Accidentally' corrupt their hard drives. Make them loose their keys. Oh shit, the car didn't start AGAIN, what could it have been? Make your ENTJ go crazy by ruining their efficiency on a daily basis due to things outside of their control. Keep this up for a few months and your ENTJ will likely break down and start crying in a dark corner.|||Be aware that if you want to print a full copy of an existing book which you got a pdf of somehow, most copy shops won't do it due to copy right laws.|||Seriously, this is why even though I will probably never get to an even somewhat fluent level in Chinese, it's still worth it for me to study it. My communication with Chinese natives when we discuss topics in English has improved *soooo* much, simply because I developed a better feeling for how their native language works in terms of cultural context. Basic things like communicating various levels of approval or consent are not basic in cross cultural settings if one of the people in the conversation does not share your cultural understanding of the language. One thing I learned growing up in a multilingual family with no real 'native' ties to their countries: communication is not about perfect grammar and vocabulary. It's about getting across what you intended to convey when you opened your mouth. Many people underestimate this when discussing cross cultural communication or learning a new language. It's not only a question of fluency. If you can adapt your use of the target language to fit the ability and background of the person you're communicating with, you'll get a lot further in actually getting your intended meaning across.|||Read your post on mobile, logged in on desktop specifically to reply to your post. You sound so much like my own SO, both in terms of your sexuality as well as your love and care for your girlfriend. Specifically the movie vs. watching the news metaphor came pretty close. I just wanted to comment from my own perspective how *I* experience my sexuality, maybe it will help you understand your girlfriend better (or maybe not) and also discuss with you how my SO and I deal with our 'incompatibility'. This is what you say about your sexual experience:This is what your say about her sexual experience:My SO and I are exactly like this. Of course, I don't know your SO and I can't tell you whether my experience and hers are the same, so I'll talk purely for myself. The act of sex is simply not that enjoyable for me. Physically, it doesn't do a lot for me. The movements are not enjoyable on their own, nor does an orgasm (which by the way, I can't do with just regular intercourse). The reason I still like sex is not the sex itself, but the experience of intimacy, just like you described here:The intimacy is *so* important for me, but it's not physical. It's mental. It's about sharing trust to be so close to each other, it's about the hugs and coziness afterwards. I have *greatly* enjoyed the sexual acts themselves at well at times, but the extreme physical satisfaction only happened when I literally lost my mind in that moment, which made the act itself a fully mental experience. The blissful feeling afterwards did not come from a physical experience, but rather a sort of feeling like I was drifting on top of a cloud inside my mind. If sexual enjoyment is 100% emotional/mental and you get no enjoyment from purely the physical act, it might become more clear why 'stupid little things' like a lingering emotional state from a fight, or not feeling comfortable due to not having showered, stops you from *wanting* sex, as you know you can't bring yourself to 'let go' and go into that emotional/mental zone in which you can really let yourself enjoy the sex fully. Just like you, I can't imagine someone not perceiving the intimacy and connectedness sex can give in a relationship, because I feel the same, but the process is so totally different between my SO and I.I do by the way initiate sex at *some* times that is driven out of some kind of horniness I guess, but these moments are few and and far in between. Still haven't really pinpointed what triggers these moments for me. (Working on it though, see below.) Anyway, unto how my SO and I deal with this. The first and most important one: **communication**. We take a moment each and every day, in which we turn off all electronics, make a cup of tea or whatever, and just sit together to talk about.. whatever. Usually we talk about what happened during the day, and if something happened either of us were not happy about or bothered with, we'd bring it up during this moment. We usually do this before going to bed. Many times, it's literally just 5 minutes. Sometimes, it takes over an hour. We never really know beforehand, but to have this moment without expectations to just talk freely without interruption has been a fundamental building block for our relationship. This is also the moment when we discuss sex. If you read more threads on sexual issues between partners, everyone will tell you: you need to discuss it when there is not sex involved. This is that moment for us. Understanding each other better was the first step for us getting into a place that suits both of us. It will be different for everyone, but here are some things we realized and how we deal with it.1. I needed to realize that even if I didn't 'feel like it' physically, the intimacy was still very much enjoyable to the extent that sex was still worthwhile, even without the physical urge. This meant that I had to learn to difference between 'not feeling like it' and 'not wanting to', and to make the conscious *decision* to have sex at times even if I wasn't 'feeling like it' in the physical sense of things.2. I am **totally** oblivious to my SO's physical arousal, as I don't experience it like he does, so my mind does not even register it. How we deal with this: when my SO gets aroused he will ask me point blank in an early stage 'would you like to have sex?'. This gives me an opportunity to consider my own mental state ('feel like it' vs 'not wanting to'). I will answer him clearly; 'yes, let's go to the bed room', 'yes, but I'd like a quick shower first, give me 10 minutes', 'no, I am really busy at the moment, but let's have sex tonight', 'no, I'm not feeling like having sex, but if you'd like, I'll give you a hand job', 'no, I am feeling really stressed at the moment, I do not **want** to have sex at this point in time'. etc.3. I need to be more in touch with my triggers and how sexuality and my mental state interacts, and I need my SO's help in this as I am so physically out of touch with myself. I *need* him to take the lead. Propose new things, and be very careful in reading my cues. And I need to talk with him and open up. Put in the energy to *really* figure myself out. This is a slow, slow process. We are still working on it 5+ years later. It's not easy. I am however incredibly impressed about how my SO has been able to understand *me* and my sexuality so well over the years. At times I feel he understand me better than I do.So, based in my personal experience, I see a couple of things in your post that I find worrisome:No, no, no. Your wants matter! Just at much as hers! Like another poster said:  After all, a relationship is about what you put in. Not what you get out. This is not okay. You don't restrict, instead you compromise for both to be happy. If compromise is not possible to the point of both of you being happy, the relationship is not sustainable. This is a problem. I have been through a lot of shit in my life, and I have faced many challenges. However, my long term relationship with this man who I want to spend my life with, has seriously been the thing that has cost me the most time and effort of everything I have undertaken in my life. A good, strong relationship is HARD word and requires *a lot* of effort and dedication. She needs to realize this (as it seems you do), or again, your relationship will not be sustainable in the long run. You say in your post *you* want to make it work and work hard at it, but is she willing to do the same?How does she feel about your happiness? In my relationship, I am happy when my SO is happy, and vice versa. We focus on each others happiness, and as a result, we achieve an amazing shared happiness. Give more than you take, and take what you need. She does not seem to do a lot of giving. Just like you (see first point of worrisome things) are not doing enough taking.Interestingly enough, the three worrisome points I outlined here have *nothing* to do with your sexual issues. Much more about how you and your SO fundamentally view your relationship and how you are developing your relationship. I wouldn't say your relationship is doomed. This shit is hard and difficult and *nobody* gets to have a strong relationship out of the blue. I'm just saying, your issue is not purely sexual. Treat the cause, and your symptoms will also fade.|||I went through my post history just now, and figured: let's have a second look at /u/boyetoy 's pictures again now that I *know* he's trans.. maybe now that I know, I will be able to spot anything that hints about you being in transition that I didn't spot before.Well.. I had a second look, and dead honest: I still don't see it. After staring at your pictures again for a minute or two even *looking* for clues, my mind still didn't see it. At one point I thought, 'well, maaaaaybe this tiny insignificant detail looks *a bit* feminine I guess'... and then my mind went: '...who am I kidding, my testosterone filled, super masculine boyfriend has exactly that same characteristic, I'm seriously just making up stuff right now because I'm looking for it.' So, there's that. Like I said: I know several trans people.. I know how tough it was for them to pass. But in your case, I honestly find it hard to believe you're a trans man going through transition right now just from looking at your pictures.  |||But... *how*? I mean sure, my leather shoes get dirtier when biking versus walking, meaning they need some more care compared to if I wouldn't bike as much, but I have *never* in my whole life actually ruined a piece of clothing because of my bike.|||Your style is great, and definitely flattering! As to your CCW: (I know this is FFA, but still) your makeup game is obviously on point, but looking through the pictures, I kept thinking 'wow, a really bold lip would be so right, right now'. Again: your make-up is seriously gorgeous, but the make-up style is so very much alike to your clothing style (colours, matte-ness) that they blend together. Having your make-up stand out just a bit more, while keeping the coordination and 'style' between make-up and outfit, would really make the whole look more interesting and quite literally stunning as peoples heads would go 'what makes this so interesting to look at?' without it being super obvious.|||That's my point, I'm really starting to believe that for many of us the chances of weather (doesn't even have to be a full blown disaster) seriously impacting us will be serious concerns. A week or two ago, my province was facing a long drought, to a point that the government had to inform people in our province to use water very sparingly, because they couldn't guarantee their supply they needed time to refill their safety reserves. My country is incredibly well developed with strong infrastructures, and yet, a *simple* draught put strains on water supplies. These droughts will become every common in my country....A winter ago we had a sudden snow storm which causes a lot of icing and grinded daily life to a halt. No public transport, and although deliveries to shops etc continued (sloooowly), it didn't take much for motorized transport to have been impossible all together. And again, these types of storms will become common in my country....The past 5 years I've experienced major changes in weather where I'm living, if this continues, I'm not sure our society's systems and infrastructure can be assumed to be fully up and running within parameters all of the time. If I expect to lose my job or have a serious health issue once every decade, and my identity or spouse maybe once in my life, it makes sense to plan for these type of scenarios that with the current climate developments are very reasonable to expect to occur on those same (and probably shorter) time frames.As much as not having the money to buy food without emergency savings when you lose your job will ensure major problems for feeding your family, simply not having access to food because of a natural disaster will do the same. |||Dear OP, your post has been removed as per rules 2 and 3 of this subreddit.|||There are actually quite some legit self help books based on scientifically backed treatments, such as on cognitive behavioural therapy.

I don't now, nationalistic/racist kind of association in the context of having a tattoo with that meaning.

Wondering if others share that feeling or not from their cultural point of view.Edit: I want to thank everyone who commented. Before you commented, I got a bunch of downvotes, which I thought was rather sad, as I see these language subreddits as a place to discuss language, culture, and how those two things influence us as human beings.

If we want to come together as mankind, we should realize that these differences exist and use that to learn to understand each other better. Some apparently did not like this.

Not a lot of people can see the value and are willing to wade through the bullshit to get to the good stuff.|||/u/P4p3Rc1iP is definitely correct. This difference between HBO vs WO vs US college is also not to be underestimated. I've had family members go to some of the best US state universities on full ride (sports) scholarships who in the Netherlands would not gain entry into a WO degree program based on their high school diploma. Although they were straight A (deans list) student sat their US state uni's, a WO program turned out to be too difficult for them when they returned home and wanted to further their education.That being said: the admissions procedure for non-EU diploma's is *not* standardized unlike what u/P4p3Rc1iP said. They are fully standardized for EU diplomas (by law), but deciding whether a non-EU diploma is up to par to a EU bachelors diploma is up to the individual institution. International Business is quite a common programme and most Dutch uni's offer this program. If I were you, considering the pre-master is financially not an option, I would simply apply at the other Dutch uni's as well and see if one of them bites.In your motivational letter, be sure to highlight any research your husband has done during his studies and what kind of research/methodology courses your husband took. If your husband did any extracurricular research projects for example, MENTION this, because admissions can also consider relevant (work) experience. All of this will go a long way to establishing your husbands diploma as 'academic' enough. |||Maybe you realized this already, maybe not, but when I look at your album, the 'edge' you're describing comes from the contrast in materials used in the outfits.

Bartender was convinced it was mine and gave it back to me.|||The thing is, not everyone *could* mentally and emotionally deal with such a situation in a relationship. Even if they would love their SO with no compare, for some, it would simply be *too much* to stand by their SO's side through something like this. That's not something on the SO, or on that person, and there is no blame to be assigned, it's simply.. reality. It's not even about just respecting (sexual) boundaries, it showing such a strong sense of understanding, love, and support to another person who is obviously deserving, but nonetheless it simply asks a lot of *you* as a person to offer these things. Your strength of character to be able to offer another person that kind of a loving relationship is something pretty amazing and says a lot about you. It might not be special *to you* because it's just something you just do and deal with because you love her, but please do understand that what you are doing *is* special when compared to the population at large. You are offering your SO something very precious and valuable, something not everyone could offer her. And that's pretty amazing in my book.|||My SO (male) has a long history of anxiety and depression. He gets literally no satisfaction whatsoever out of his job on top of it causing him (health impacting) stress.I however am very much a career driven person and am aiming for a top earning career. We discussed this thoroughly, but in about a year or so I need to move across the country to take a critical career step. At that point, he'll look for a part time job doing something he enjoys, even if low paying, and he will become a house husband who will take care of cleaning, laundry, grocery shopping, cooking etc. I want him to take a few years and just be able to experiment with different jobs and different paths so he can figure out what he actually likes to do. The past 10 years have been awful for him, in which his life was pushed forward by one shit fluke of life after another, instead of him making conscious choices about what he wants out of life. Some stability, calmness and no financial pressure regarding *having* to provide for us will help him a lot. And who knows. Maybe in a couple of years he'll decide to get back in the game full time!Him taking care of our house will also make sure I can indeed pull the necessary 60-70 hours a week to push my career in the direction I want. My income alone would be double median household income in my country after a year or two, plus there is still his part time income, so we definitely won't be hurting for money.|||That's what government is for, I guess. In my country, if you're ill, you can fire of an email or give your employer a call simply stating 'I'm ill so I'm not coming in today'. If your employer doesn't believe you, they can send an independent GP to your house that same day to see whether you're truly ill. That GP will write a report which will simply state something like 'employee is ill and will stay home for the next 5 days'. They are not allowed to disclose anything about your condition and the employer has to pay all costs related to this GP visit.Also, as soon as you're officially claiming you're ill your employer by law is not allowed to fire you and is required by law to continue your pay. Even if your illness continues for months, your employer can't do anything about it.It gets better. If you start slowly recovering from serious illness, that independent GP will be the one to guide you through a reintegration process. The GP can tell the employer that you are now healthy enough to work one day per week for the next month and they'll evaluate your condition again at the end of that month. You now still have full legal protection against being fired and can slowly work towards recovery.But what if your illness causes you not to be able to do the job you had (ever) again? Also protected by law, because it's the employers responsibility to either give you a new position within the company at the same pay that you can do, or for them to pay to get you transferred to another company where you are able to work.If you have a temp contract and your contract finished while you're ill, you enter a special government program in which the government will continue to pay you your salary, because obviously, if your ill you can't enter the job market so not having an income is not your fault.What is you are officially declared healthy again and your employer decided to fire you out of retaliation? Perfect, find yourself an employment lawyer because that's discriminatory behaviour and our justice system does not accept that shit at all.|||Depending on how many you have of these + how long you have to wait: I put them at them as a little check box at the bottom of the weekly page.

Can you link me to the one you own?|||I think Germany is the same as the Netherlands in this regard, as in if you *naturalize* in Germany, you need to give up other nationalities, but if you already have German nationality and you obtain another one, with that new country not demanding you to give up your German citizenship, the government doesn't care. |||So, why not? It will only cost you a couple of hundred bucks. Getting it now will also allow you to pass on citizenship to your spouse and children (if part of the equation). If S actually HTF you'll have no chance getting it in the chaos of things, but it might be a golden ticket out of the chaos. |||How are you doing now?|||Do it. Seriously. I'm not even kidding. Especially if the others colleagues don't agree with this arse, it will put him on the spot and he'll back off. The thing is, your comment can be a blueprint for *any* shit comment he might make regarding you, your clothes, appearance or any other 'feminine' expression of you (which these kinds seem to go after a lot). Practice saying this in your head, and before you know it, you'll be saying it out loud.|||I mean, in the context of am academic institution, this IS the way to address this. If she wants to convince others (her professors even) she should play the game of scientific method and discuss her thoughts in the context of available scientific data.She wouldn't win that argument, of course, but if she'd actually do this, any prof worth their salt would take the opportunity as a major learning moment to discuss what it means to do science and produce good scientific data.|||I never stopped to figure that emergency systems testing wouldn't be a common occurrence in other countries... how often does this happen in the US? In my country, they test the system monthly. |||We have about 10 universities in the Netherlands, and all 10 of them are ranked pretty similarly (all are top 50 - 150 worldwide), with some universities having a local expertise they are known for. Doing a masters is also really common (almost expected), so most of the times, students pick the closest or the most 'fun' university for their bachelor and move to another for their master depending on which has the best local expertise. Like the high school system, university educational quality is also under tight government supervision. This also makes sure that all universities adhere to the same (obviously high considering the ranking) standard. In general, there is not really much a prestige battle going on between Dutch unis. The high school selection isn't super strict by the way. The simplified explanation: there are 3 tiers, respectively taking 4, 5, and 6 years of education and all start at 12 years old. At the end of primary school, students take sort of IQ test to place them. If you end up in the highest tier, you'll be 18 when you finish. If you do the middle tier, you're 17. With the middle tier diploma, you are also allowed to enrol in the fifth year of the highest tier education. Meaning you can still get the highest tier diploma by 19.Similarly, tertiary education is tiered. A lower tier tertiary diploma grants access to higher tier programs. All these points of access to education are formalized by law, because again, education is a right, not a privilege.I've known people who did the lowest high school tier, and studied their way up to a university master diploma by the time they were 28 or so.|||I've known a few as well who put their foot down and didn't do more than the required hours.. however, next to what you noted (which is absolutely true), many of them also struggled to maintain a good relationship with their PIs... which becomes problematic even if you don't want to stay in academia, because they are literally the only one who can be your employee reference of the past 4-6 years.|||Don't worry about it too much. The Science and Engineering faculty (maths is part of this one) has a really strong student community, and all study associations etc. have been actively working on truly embracing the internationalization the faculty went through for years already.. They are way ahead on this compared to other associations and clubs. |||Thank you for writing up this comment. I'm doing a double masters in both the Business and Engineering domain. Lately the field of systems engineering caught by eye for what I want to do after I graduate. Being a business analyst sounds similar, only it focuses on IT systems opposed to the design of physical engineering objects (which often include heavy IT aspects). I'm definitely going to do some additional reading on your field. It sound pretty amazing. |||When I read the title, my answer was 'how do you *not* stay focused on your goals?'. I guess this is indeed why.|||I was doing a course on inorganic chemistry, learning about orbital theory. Next to me was one of my best friends who was born to actually be a chemist. He was going on about how beautiful all of it was, and the only thing I could do was stare at the whiteboard in front of me and think: ' what on earth did I get myself into, what's the point of all of this, I need to do something more useful in my life. 'Yeah.. I officially switched immediately after finishing that course.|||Do it! I think the biggest mental hurdle is that jogging =/= running while feeling like your lungs are going to explode. Especially in the beginning, a slow jog is exactly that: slow. It clicked in my mind when I was reading some pro runners blog when someone said that for the slow run when starting out, you probably could match the speed trying to *walk* really fast. |||Ik heb zelf lange tijd aan de Vrydemalaan gewoond en mijn vriend aan de Antillenstraat voordat we gingen samenwonen.De Vrydema containers zijn gewoon ronduit (véél) beter. Nieuwer, groter, betere kwaliteit materiaal, en minder aso brommertjes volk. De badkamer van de Vrydemalaan studio's is ook 100x beter, plus, er is een wasmachine aansluiting (die is er niet aan de Antillenstraat dus je moet of wassen bij je ouders of langs de wasserette). Dat verwarmingselement is kut in beide locaties (inherent aan wonen in een container), maar die van de Vrydemalaan is wel beter. Bij mijn vriend moesten we gewoon constant een klein verwarmingselement aan hebben staan in de winter omdat ik het anders oprecht niet trok met de kou.Het is wel gehorig, je hoort bijvoorbeeld mensen over de gangen lopen, maar het is niet per se storend. Ik zou wel twijfelen om een studio te accepteren die vooraan vlak bij de trappen zitten. Hoe verder naar achter, hoe beter. Het enige wat ik naar vond aan Vrydemalaan en wat minder erg was bij de antillenstraat: de afstand tussen containers. Je kunt behoorlijk bij elkaar naar binnen kijken. Ik heb er echt met ontzettend veel plezier gewoond. Alles voor jezelf hebben is gewoon zo fijn en de locatie is perfect. Als ik het over moest doen, zou ik precies dezelfde keuze gemaakt hebben.|||If you meet any, instead of giving compliments, *please* just tell us what we are doing crap. I am so fed up with not getting any critical feedback from people. Even after outright asking they just say \\\"everything's fine, you're doing great!\\\". Yeah, I know that already, else I wouldn't ask you how how to improve myself even further, you're comment in no help at all. Want an ENTJ friend for life? Call them out on their bullshit already. |||I've read through most of your comments on this subject, and I get you, I have the exact same contemplation... but this comment you just made sits quite wrong with me.

I don't know, man. |||There are quite a bunch of English taught undergrad degrees in the Netherlands. One of the more expensive countries for non EU citizen tuition fees though.Applying for universities in Europe isn't a crapshoot like in the US. Especially in NL, if your son meets the entry requirements (unless it's a degree with a limitation on enrolment, like medicine), you'll get an offer. It's part of the equal access to education laws to be non discriminatory towards applicants. For the Netherlands, in general for US high school degree holding applicants you'd need 3 to 5 relevant (as in, related to the field your son wants to study) APs to get entry into a Dutch university.|||Anecdotes stop being anecdotes when they are universally shared experiences among a group. In the case of women: I've yet to meet anyone who *hasn't* come across these issues. |||This is similar to how I experience Ni as an ENTJ.

It make me feel extremely confused when going through puberty (being a sexual person, but not experiencing sexual attraction like the other girls did). The lack of life experiences that age simply left a bunch of blank space that needed to be filled in before I could actually see the bigger picture.|||I know, the guy was a-ma-zing. He just thought himself to be a professional tradesman like a plumber or electrician, only he would fix up bones and ligaments instead. He was simply a dude who loves his job and would just joke around all day while doing his job.  Down to earth, no ego or 'holier-than-thou' attitude, and not afraid to call out his colleagues - be it surgeons or administrative staff - when they fucked up (which happened.. a lot..). I remember when administration made a mistake in planning, which would result in having to push back my surgery with 2 weeks. I went to see him and told him in tears that I couldn't handle waiting 2 weeks, because I was fully bed bound and stressed until I could have that surgery. He called the planning department right on the spot with me next to him, told them this was unacceptable, and that they have to change it right now, or else plan me on his emergency trauma shift instead that week, because there was no way he's was letting me wait. It took a loooong time for me to get healthy again, but this guy seriously made a major positive difference in how I experienced that awful time.|||Yeah, I found those criteria going through the Women Scientists WikiProject page. I just emailed my long-time mentor with a link to this article. She's a full professor in physics who has quite the track record of pushing women's causes in academia. She actually meets (quick count) 5 of the criteria mentioned, so she definitely would qualify, but does not have her own page. Another quick count makes me come up with about ~10 other professors already I know within the STEM department that would qualify. Maybe I can get my mentor to let me write her page and get that ball rolling.|||I'm not sure we're even talking about the same type of communism to be honest. 'True communism' in my book is Marxist communism. And from that perspective, communism will arise through socialism, through a power shift from capital owners to production workers. In Marxist socialism, different abilities are very much rewarded and differentiated in. Google 'To each according to their contribution'. Contribution equals productive output, and a good manager will contribute a lot to that output and is valued accordingly and will as such still receive more compensation than workers that add less to the output productivity. Just like capitalism pushes leadership forward, so would socialism. Socialism will ultimately push production to an all time high according to Marx, leading to a status quo in which production is so high, there is enough for everyone, leading to the concept of 'from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs', which is communism. Now imagine growing up in a world where there is abundance and little to want. This would give freedom (social imperative even) to explore how you as an individual contribute best to society (see for example 24th century earth in the Star Trek universe). That process is slow though.If you are only picturing a failed communist Soviet state as benchmark for 'what communism is' I don't know why you're even asking this question. A flawed system will lead to flawed outcomes. Nothing new there.|||I also use Estee Lauder foundation (but not DoubleWear). I think all of Estee Lauders foundations are silicone based, no? At least, mine is.. It makes sense for Biore Watery Essence to pill, as it's a water based formulation. There is a reason why you need to match silicone foundations with silicone primers. Maybe you could try using a water based foundation instead?|||Exactly. I stood by my SO's side through mental illness, and yes, if you love him you *should* stand by his side. However, you should not stand by his side *and help him work through it*. You should stand by someone's side *while they work through it*. My SO was dealing with depression and anxiety and worked DAMN hard to resolve his issues through therapy. The thing is, it was **him** that did the work, not me. He showed me day in day out he was committed to work through his problems and have a life with me. That's why I stood by his side. It's not your job to fix someone else, nor *can* you fix someone else. They need to be willing and able to fix themselves.|||My SO's grandparents openly discuss their final wishes with us. They are both in their 80s, have been together since they were teenagers, they traveled the world, and in every way lived their life the way they want even if society disagreed. They still love each other so much and value their independence. The last years, their health has been deteriorating, and although they still are able to live on their own (because they have each other), they are now at the point where they are looking into assisted suicide, so they may die together, in peace, before their minds and bodies are too far gone. Frankly, I think it's beautiful and they are right in wanting to do this. They claimed ownership over their lives and now wish to claim ownership over their deaths. |||Perfect, that will work out!

Thank you. :)|||What the.. then how on earth do you ensure the objective quality of your diploma?|||I'm not doing this masters, but from my experience with other research masters, these will be the most important questions: what bachelor degree do you have? Does your university rank similar to the RUG in terms of research? What were your grades? Was your bachelor thesis on a topic related to spatial sciences and how was it graded? Can you properly address why you want to do a research master and how you intend to benefit from the freedom offered by the program? Maybe you already have some specific areas of interest you would like to explore while doing this master?|||Usually scales have a tare button that resets the weight to zero.

Anyway, you can start doing this already. I'm guessing you need income, so start finding a job first. But creating educational services is something you can start doing right now by starting out as a volunteer, looking out for educational non-profits, after school programmes, etc etc and building your network in that industry. Frankly, all the examples you mention that inspire you are all project build by men and women from scratch and who achieved those goals through nothing but very, very hard work, a proper dosage of luck (don't underestimate this.. sadly), and the discipline to keep up that work for decades at the time before they saw success. Non of this requires even more schooling than you have now, but it does require a special personality and work ethic.|||This actually isn't a silly approach. I am a STEM graduate with a major love for languages, but that love was mostly solidified by learning Latin in high school. We learned Latin as a means to an end to discuss and evaluate ancient Roman texts in high school and the language was taught from a *very* analytical point of view. The people who had a talent for STEM typically excelled at Latin because of this and it gave me deeper understanding of all other living languages I studied as well. I'm now learning Mandarin and the same analytical approach I was taught when studying Latin became critical to learning Chinese, because everything about it is so *foreign* and unintuitive. |||That's the point of the post: it *isn't* practical to religiously schedule time off, but that doesn't mean it isn't important.|||I've read through your whole thread. You come across as such a kind and caring woman. You love your husband, your kids, yours in-laws, and want nothing more than to see them happy. Clearly, family and peace and harmony within the family are important values to you. Your kindness is also what hurts me when reading through your comments. You are a woman willing to give it all to make your loved ones happy, but clearly, your loved ones don't value making *you* happy as much. You give so much space to your husband so he can be happy, only for him to not care when you agreed on doing something that is important for your happiness. And I'm not even talking about the Judaism thing, your weekend get away is telling. 'yeah I booked tickets to a game even though you planned and books hotels already because I *knew* you wouldn't mind'. And no, you didn't make a fuss, because you wanted him happy, he knows this, and used it without regard for *your* happiness. I mean. What about your in-laws. They think it's important to go to church as a family, knowing you're not a Christian. Do they also celebrate Hanukkah with you togeher as a family (even at home, out of sight of the public?). Why not? Why is this small, yearly show of affection towards you too much to ask if you are willing to go to church with them so often?My point is. YOU MATTER. Your happiness **matters**. Yes, give it your all to love others, but you deserve the same love and attention in return.My SO and I have a saying in our relationship. A relationship is about giving 60% and taking 40%, because if both do so, there will always be enough to go around for both of us and we will both grow and benefit from the relationship. You are giving all and taking none, while your husband is not even willing to give a little. That's a really unhealthy situation, for both of you.|||I have an *insane* academic track record in both undergrad and grad, which makes people's jaw fall open when they hear about it through the grapevine. When they ask me how on earth I managed my study load on top of my extra curriculars, my answer has been consistently the same over the years: do only things you *want* to do during the weekends - even if that's nothing at all -  and leave everything you *have* to do for during weekdays. |||Have you considered taking a flixbus?

Even if they don't know you and will never speak to you, you can still (subconsciously) imprint that message onto the world. Outrageousness definitely has its place in fashion, but with her, I can't stop to think: what's *her* message to the world by dressing like that? I don't know, I look at this outfit, and the only thing I think of is: wow, she really must **not** want to be seen. The whole outfit is so overwhelming to the point the only mental image I had when I scrolled away was a big fluffy leopard print coat with a WHOOOOLE bunch of confusing colours and shapes all into one.. my confusion about what she's presenting was overwhelming to a point I did not get any impression of her as a person, because in that split second we take to evaluate someone on appearance, my brain had no computing power left to wade through the confusion and actually look at *her*. |||Thats the point though, if Buffett were Dutch, he actually *would* get a check every month from the government...|||You'd be surprised....

In this particular example, the company does a lot of projects in the Arabic peninsula. These women went to Saudi Arabia for projects and I asked them some tough questions on how to company dealt with more feminist issues regarding sending off their female employees to these countries and the expectations the company enforcers from the people they do projects for in those countries.

If you would have a data science background through CS, and you have an niche in that field you highly specialize in, by the time you're done, you could start actively approaching companies with the message 'I can do something you don't even know yet you want'. Do you already have access to which courses will be available to you? You should really think through your selection of courses to experience parts of everything that might interest you. Besides maybe dipping your toes in pure economics to see if you like it, I would recommend you taking more specific courses on all kinds of subjects, and really focus on how your interest in data science can be applied to those fields. Courses on.. I don't know... spatial planning of cities (big data visualization of user behaviours), behavioural psychology (machine learning on multivariate data sets), organic chemistry (computational chemistry to predict potential drug agents), American history (handwriting recognition programming), and maybe even courses on topics like technology entrepreneurship. Wouldn't it be great if through one of these courses you would find a topic that really sparks some passion in you, on which you could apply your data science background and do something probably only a few other people in the world could do because the combination of skills and interests would be so unique?|||I took over a year to get where I am now (about 10 kg lost). I simply went back to the habits I had at my original weight, so the deficit is small, but in the end, I'll move back to my original weight.

My post definitely wasn't meant as a setup, nor am I upvoting/downvoting any of your posts by the way. Just honestly curious about how other people perceive things and think about topics like these. My (honest) reaction to your answer: I do feel that maybe you are projecting quite a bit of your own negative experiences/experiences of people close to you on OPs case. I also count my calories for weight-loss previously and now to maintain (went from obese to overweight, will start losing some more weight when I am in a better frame of mind again). I find that especially in today's world in which sedentary lifestyles and typical food consumption patterns are *really* an issue for public health this is really important, because society is teaching us some very unhealthy habits. In my opinion, *everyone* (of any weight) should be counting calories and make sure they have enough exercise simply to make sure you keep a healthy diet and yes, this includes counting calories burned with exercise because you need to make sure you're not burning too much, because too few calories a day are also unhealthy. None of that *needs* to be obsessive or unhealthy - although it can be, like you noted - but to reply to anyone who counts calories with 'are you sure you don't have mental issues or are in an abusive relationship' without a direct lead for that actually being the case is... extreme.  |||I think this is a thing as well. Whenever I visit other countries with less of a 'biking culture' I usually see people on sports/hybrid bikes, even just for their daily commute. You rarely see these sports bikes in the Netherlands, except when someone is actually working out or training for races. We all ride 'granny bikes' as we call them despite riding them all year round. All open parts are covered, soft saddle, upright riding position, etc. Google 'dutch people on bikes' if you want to have a glimpse of what a Dutch morning community looks like. I don't think I could reasonable use a sports bike dressing like I usually do.. I've never actually been on a sports bike to be honest.|||As a Dutch person with a ChemEng background and a SO with Chem background: what kind of career in chemistry are you pursuing what kind of related job experience do you have already?

I don't know, because I'm not one.. My INTP SO however is also very direct in communication once he does communicate, but he has a harder time actually taking the step in telling me stuff. He mulls it over more often, thinking 'I'm bothering her, no need to tell her' etc even though that's really not the case and he just needs to tell me. He's learning though and getting better at it. For both of us, talking about emotions, feelings, doubts and stressors is learned behaviour. We approach our communication it in a highly methodological, rule based manner (we're both academically trained scientist NTs after all...). One of the major rules is, everything that bothered you today, needs to be addressed today. We set time aside every day to discuss this (every. single. fucking. day.). This can even just be a comment like 'you said you would take out the trash. You didn't. That annoyed me.' or really profound doubts and other issues about our lives.|||This hits a bit too close to home. You live now and only now. Today will be gone forever in just a few hours.

But I did *want* to succeed, so I understood I had to work hard. I made a deal with myself: if I didn't want to do stupid jobs on the side which were killing me mentally, fine, don't but instead I made myself work my ass off on my studies instead. I justified taking out student loans by making sure I understood that performing absolutely the best I could academically we as now my job. And that I should do anything to make myself attractive for future job markets. I'm almost done with grad school and companies are starting to find me with really good offers. I will pay off my loans in no time and set myself up on a pretty awesome career path. Whatever you choose: success and hard work are correlated.

And if she goes in for an exchange: don't feel bad. Finding clothing that fits on a particular woman's body is not easy. If you want to maximize your chances of the items fitting like they should: are these brands she already owns other items from?

I mean, I'm a white woman so I wouldn't know for certain, but I truly don't think you'd face serious issues here.

If you don't have preconceived notions of race, nor do you have a socially ingrained sense of racism, *and* you simply haven't met many people who are non-white to form your opinion about... yeah, you'd might look different, but how you look doesn't subconsciously carry all these issues that maybe would come with it in other social settings.Yes, the Netherlands has a long winded history when it comes to colonization and slave trade, but the impact on society in terms of racial perception was not the same as in many other countries. The slave trade and everything that followed was 'out there' and not necessary in the Netherlands itself. We had plantations for slaves to work on... in East India.. not in our direct backyards. The consequences of Dutch history are much less socially intertwined than let's say the US, where many people can still trace back their lineage to their ancestors either having been slaves or being slave owners. Sure, people are still discriminated against in the Netherlands, just like (sadly) everywhere else... but in the Netherlands, I feel this is much more due to *xenophobic* undertones than necessarily racist undertones.(Sensitive topics to start about, I hope it won't blow up...) You can see this for example in the discussion surrounding 'Black Pete' during the Sinterklaas celebration (sort of like Dutch santa claus). Obviously, Black Pete is *incredibly* racist in its fundament... however, for most people there *truly* is not a single ounce of racist *intent* which makes it difficult for people to see why using the Black Pete caricature can be problematic, especially because things like blackface never really were a thing in the Netherlands like they were in the UK/US. When people start to oppose the Dutch tradition of Black Pete, the anger of Black Pete supporters has much more to do with 'outsiders' demanding 'insiders' to change their way of doing things, and much less about their 'right to be racist'.|||I don't get why you keep coming back to some current capitalist societal standard of 'success' or 'rank' is what defines ENTJs in the first place. An ENTJ will have high potential for succes in any kind of society, be it dystopian or utopian, because they find intrinsic purpose within their external context. And yes, the society will influence this purpose, we are Te dominant after all so our inspirations come from society, but inspiration will be there in any society. ENTJs work to achieve and do what they want, and there *always* be something else to want.|||Reading the other comments I got (they don't even *want* to) miss a big part of the point in my opinion. Emphasis mine: A culture is nothing more than a set of shared beliefs, values, and understanding that gets defined by the people who belong to that culture. Paradoxically, a culture is shaped by those who belong to that culture. Whether 'the outsider' wants to or not is not the first question to ask, it's whether 'the insiders' are willing to open up the circle and let 'the outsider' be part of the group of people that shape their culture. If you don't let them join, you can't expect them to be part of it. And I get it feels scary and threatening to do so, but it is needed. A young man who I'm mentoring now is expecting a baby girl soon. He is so excited for her to grow up in this country, *be part of it*, that even though he as 'an outsider' does not feel welcomed into the circle of Dutch culture 'insiders', he and his wife consciously chose a name for their daughter that has significance in Arabic, but still would easily fit into the Dutch culture and language. As outsiders, they try to act as insiders, and still they are not welcomed into the circle. Even if some 'don't want to', the fact remains that those who *do* want to are being barred regardless of their will and effort.  |||With ec you mean educational credits? In that case: well, yes.. I can guarantee you, multiple engineering diplomas don't suddenly materialize out of thin air. It was (still is) hard work, requiring a lot of discipline. |||I think the first thing that's good to realize that you will (very, very likely) *never* sound like a native speaker. *And that's ok*. Think about your own native language: how often does it happen you hear someone from a more remote region and their accent sounds a bit funny. Even native speakers don't always sound like the standard accent. I've known so many people who've immigrated to my country and have been here for 20+/30+ years. They speak the language just fine (in terms of grammar, etc.), but they *still*(!) sound non-native, even after spending most of their life in this country. But again: that's ok! It also is not necessary to sound like a native, as long as people can understand you and your accent is not causing problems in your communication. |||The Law on Higher Education and Scientific Research (Wet Hoger Onderwijs en Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, WHW) deals with all laws related to universities. Chapter 2 of that law has everything on state funding of universities, and article 5 of that chapter states that the use of state funding for private activities (which includes housing) is bound by additional rules as set forward by the ministry of education. You can find a letter from the ministry from 2005 that goes in great detail when private investments by universities are allowed. Google HO/CBV/05/22162 if you want to find it. Short summary: universities are only allowed to invest public funds in private activities if those private activities align very close with the primary objective of the University (education and research) and under strict supervision of the ministry. Providing student housing does not fall under the primary objective of universities, ergo, they can't invest in it. Last year, the minister of education made a very clear comment about the international student housing issue in parliament that again reiterated that universities are not responsible for the housing situation (if you want, I can find you the minutes of that discussion, will need to look it up): universities have the responsibility to inform their (prospective) students about the situation and to share their numbers with the municipality as much as possible to ensure the municipality can act on those numbers in a timely fashion. Ensuring capacity is the municipality's job, while actually finding a place to say, is the sole responsibility of the student itself.|||Just saying.. but you do realize you'll be coming over to The Netherlands where 1,9 m tall is only considered *slightly* above average?

Your education is the foundation that (should have) taught you how to study, learn, work with people, grow discipline and a good work ethic, and think critically and *maybe* some basic understanding of a field you want to end up in. This comes from a someone close to your age who is finishing up three master degrees (in engineering and business) simultaneously and who *still* isn't truly prepared for the real world. You should spend your time figuring out what you want to do with your life first and figure out your best path towards that goal second. That goal may include getting additional education, but it also may not. |||Here's my secret holy grail that's affordable, organic, and fully produced in Europe under good working conditions: [ATO Berlin](https://www.atoberlinshop.de/).3 years ago, I bought their organic [Caya t-shirt](https://www.atoberlinshop.de/damen/oberteile-jacken/longsleeves/402/ls-caja-oc-dgrn) and [Jackie jeans in black] (https://www.atoberlinshop.de/damen/jeans-unterteile/jeans/611/jeans-jackie-05770-blk?number=9920066400747) - which on me is flared (yessss!) instead of straight by the way. Both are part of their standard collection, so they're continuously available.I have had issues for years finding jeans due to my rather large upper legs and butt, combined with a small waist size. These fit *perfectly*. Furthermore: after three years of using these jeans quite intensively, the colour hasn't faded (and remember, it's black!), nor is there even a sign of the fabric between my thighs thinning due to walking and biking.Some months ago, I bought the *same* pants in dark and light blue, because I loved them so much. And here's the thing: the quality is exactly the same high level I expected it to be! That also tells me this company is doing something right with regard to valuing their quality. I'll probably be buying the Caya shirt in 1 or 2 more colours later this year as well. This shirt has also kept up amazingly, although my armpits faded a bit because I had a bad run in with a low quality deodorant which fucked up quite some garments... Not an issue with the t-shirt though!|||Your sister is an amazing role model and standard for how a woman can be despite many disadvantages in life (even if your family is wealthy).

If you decide to have kids, I do believe it's your responsibility as a parent to dedicate your life to this new life you created. Even though I felt the typical societal life script dogma telling me to have children, I realized I could never be a mother like your mother is. I just don't have it in me to put the kid first and make raising the kid a top priority. In my ideal world, only people like your mother would have children (resulting in way less children as well, because overpopulation is a big deal). And frankly, I wouldn't even mind if these mothers and fathers who were born to be parents were given substantial governmental aid to help them with the costs of childcare and have them home more often because they'd have to work less. Their value to society would be to raise children and raise them *well*. |||In theory yes, in practice no.

However, that doesn't necessarily mean 'I dress well because I want men to see me as a sexual pursuit', nor does it mean 'I dress well because I want to make other women jealous' - although, for some it will be. I also dress up well 'to impress others', but my reasons are different. I know that looking groomed and nice has a significant (subconscious!) influence on how competent a woman is considered to be by others. Dressing well in my case is to 'impress people' so I get the best possible opportunities in my career. Others might dress up because it makes them feel more confident, because 'people who are impressed' by your grooming simply treat you better when you are groomed opposed to when you are not. Etc. Etc. Etc.You are being down voted because 'dressing to impress people'  =/=  it being fare to objectify women as sexual objects just because they look nice (implying that that's the only reason why a woman might dress up).|||I have a winter coat coming in after Christmas that I ordered, but I'm not sure if I should keep it. It's from my favourite women's business clothing shop (regional designer with about a dozen shops) which is on the pricey side. Even on sale, the coat is just under 300 euros. It's a very nice, formal looking wool coat in camel. I originally ordered it because I know next winter I'll be working in a very business formal setting (consultancy) and I'll need to be able to present myself well next to my colleagues. Anyone who has a business formal wool coat they love (or hate!) and want to share tips for what to look out for before I decide to keep the coat?|||Is your curriculum different in year three/masters?I'm in chemeng and industrial eng (double degree) in the Netherlands and what you've described is also very typically here, but only for the first and (large parts of) the second year. From year three onwards, it's mostly project based learning where you are asked to deal (fictional) industrial, product, or technological problems for which you need to find a solution over the course of about 10 weeks in teams of varying sizes and backgrounds. The bachelor projects are rather simple, structured and straightforward, while the master projects are usually very rich in decision making and complex. For example, I just finished up a project where the whole class was asked to develop parts of an integrated biobased chemical industry park in which we had to keep in constant communication with other groups on their decision making, because in the end, all projects needed to be integrated together.The grade has both group and individual components and is based on the report, presentations, and oral exams in which you need to defend your work.|||My mom was like you, she never had a problem with me (her daughter) seeing her naked. It was just the most normal thing ever growing up. Even as a teenager, there was no issue in me entering the bathroom while she was in the tub or shower if I had to grab something. Even now as adults, if we are visiting each other, it happens really often either of us has to get a change of clothes and we just do this in front of each other while we're chatting.My mom and I definitely have issues, but her attitude to nudity throughout my life had a major impact on my self confidence and selfesteem. It also made me more secure when going through puberty, because I knew what 'real' bodies looked like and how having a 'real' female body was normal and nothing to be ashamed of.|||Note however that if you're in STEM all masters will be 2 years. They are not officially accredited as research Masters, even though at most unis the research component will be bigger compared to many research Masters in other fields. The whole what's better for a PhD question becomes irrelevant for STEM domains.(I get that you were asking about a MA, just adding this in case others read this in the future.)In your case: especially if your field is very competitive, say, psychology, I think a rMA is really your only option if you want to have a chance at a PhD spot after. I've known *very* few arts students who got into a PhD after a non rMA, and those were simply exceptional students who their professors were willing to bend over backwards to get them in their group. Even from those students who did a rMA, it was still very competitive afterwards to get one of those few PhD spots after graduating. It's not a guarantee at all.|||Ja, er zijn twee instroommomenten zeg maar met bijbehorend introprogramma en activiteiten. In september na de kei, en in februari.|||I love you're outfits.

For me, it started making sense once I realized that, yes, I do use Ni *a lot*, but it is always supporting my Te. How did I notice? My thinking is always 'outside in'. My Ni framework of life and things and everything else gets referenced often, but it's always in response to something happening in the external world which makes my Te go 'hmm, that's interesting/weird/stupid/funny.' I don't know.. the maturing of my functions of my process made my Ni more visible. As my Te developed, it picked up smaller details in the external world and make more interconnections between constructs in the external worlds, while my Ni network of things just grew and grew the more info it got fed. In that sense, my Ni was *felt* as if it was developing much more than my Te, as it was more obvious. For INTJs it's different. With INTJs, their Ni network of things is dominant, and they *project* their Ni unto the world. A bit like how an ENTJ goes: this is the world, this is how it *could* be, how to change it? While an INTJ goes: this is how the world *should* be,  this is how the world is, how do I change it?|||*Or....* physics is simply not the right pick for OP, because the same feelings and signs are also very typical for students who simply haven't found their place in the academic playground yet and *should* try something else. Yes, only OP can decide this for herself, but the insistent 'it's 100% impostor syndrome, just fight through it, you will be fine' is also not helping things if it ends up OP has far more interest and talent for another field which she's not aware of yet. Most people make a choice to study something based on very limited insight and experience into the field and *themselves*. Finding out that another choice for another field is a *better* choice, doesn't invalidate your original choice as *wrong*, or makes you in any way a loser or whatever if you decided to change course a bit (or even a lot). I've mentored several dozen undergrads long term and taught several hundreds of undergrad students. And the majority of students who felt like OP is feeling and decided to switch a different field are extremely happy they did, because they felt they belonged better in their new fields. And yes, some regretted their decision and came back. If you read my original comment, I said this: I never said she can't be a physicist and *should* switch. My point is: it's an option and it might be the right option for her based on what she wrote. And if it is, she shouldn't let feelings like 'I'm a failure for dropping out of physics' stop her, because that's bull shit.|||Your link post concerns an link post of stationary, which goes against rule 2: Post that focus on non-productivity related content/topics will be removed (incl. cover pages, drawings, **stationary**, etc.).

Its quite easy to wear these styles and shapes without looking costume-y.

I also combine my looks with modern jewellery, shoes, etc. This style goes incredibly well with a leather jacket for example.

There seems to be some differences between countries in the use of the word thesis vs. dissertation. In Europe (mainland at least), every bachelor and master program has a thesis, in which the student needs to do some independent (but typically guided by a PhD supervisor) research. The report that follows is called a thesis. In my country, a PhD also delivers a thesis (PhD thesis), while in some other EU countries, bachelor/master students deliver theses, while PhD students deliver dissertations. |||Eeehmm.. what? EU  *definitely* does not have a Muslim majority. Where are you getting your info?|||I'm not in CS, but I know the programme pretty well. The drop out rate is really high in the first year, and in my opinion, there are three main reasons for this:1. 18 year olds not knowing what they are getting themselves into due to CS not being taught in highschool. It's not all fun, roses, and moonshine, and you won't be building games all the time. It's actually very theoretical (but of course you will spend a lot of time on developing practical programming skills) and a true academic degree.2. These are usually boys with a pretty strong intellect, who have cruised through high school and never learned how to be disciplined and actually work for their education. Or, boys who have autism or ADD for which they received lots of hand on support during high school, which simply is not available at uni to the same extent, and who in the end can't manage the programme because of it.3. Underestimating the amount of mathematics requires. You will do pretty in depth calculus, linear algebra, etc etc. Lots of students also don't realize this, and especially in combination wit point 2, they fail these courses miserably. Considering mathematics is the foundation to practically any higher level course, this kind off has a compounding effect throughout the degree program.Anyway, I think you should evaluate whether these apply to you. I have know many people who got a negative matching advice, still enrolled, and are managing pretty well. Also, depending on your high school diploma, is you fulfill the requirements for CS, you'll likely fulfill the requirement of many other STEM degrees as well. If after a few months you decide it's not for you, there are always options to switch and do something else without losing too much time.|||I'm EU based. In my country each degree programme at university level simply has a set curriculum, and it's up to you how you manage to get all the credits (with the exception that you can't start your research thesis without having close to all of your regular course credits for obvious reasons). Once you have all credits, you apply for your diploma and that's it. Seems similar to what you are describing for the US. The difference is that in the EU, you don't do gen ed, you simply enroll for a degree and study that degree from the start. There is some space for electives, but not as much as with many US colleges. The core curriculum is set from start till finish.You don't get to sit with an adviser or whatever about a personalized path to agree which courses you take or not: you know your curriculum and how you manage it is up to you. Whether you can call that flexibility.. I guess so. In my case, it meant getting 50 credits a semester, instead of the regular study load of 30 credits and taking a year extra. |||Minors (under 18s) are fully covered by law, paid for by the state regardless and don't have to pay anything for healthcare, and between 18 and 21 it indeed helps women to gain access to contraceptives by reducing any cost barrier. When I started on my birth control at 15 something, I just called my GP for an appointment myself. Discussed my options. Walked out with a prescription. Went into the pharmacy and walked away with my medication a few minutes later. No cost. No parental consent needed. And parents definitely did not get informed about it in any way, because of privacy laws. Same for abortions or STD testing. In my experience, minors are taken quite seriously when it comes to their sexual health and the institutions work quite hard to facilitate these minors to take care of themselves in that regard.Also, proper sex education at 12 years old in which we were taught about a range of contraceptives (and all common STDs, etc) and tested on our knowledge to pass biology class. Both the girls and the boys had to learn about them and how they actually prevent pregnancy.|||Exactly.

I think I might just not be a fan of the striped dress in general. I don't know, I really like your style and especially the *fit* of your clothes on you (despite the large variety of shapes you wear, which makes that feat quite impressive!) but the striped dress just doesn't really spark that same feeling of perfect fit like the others...  That being said, if you don't want the tiny waist silhouette (like in the other picture with this skirt on your IG), but rather the focus on volume on the bottom, how about you try this skirt with the orange top you wore in one of your other pictures (with the green trousers)?That tank top is is a bit boxier with more straight lines, which I guess would make the skirt look even bigger than it already is.|||Which is why we *shouldn't* have DST as a standard during winter! Having GMT as standard is much more healthy for us, as will every biologist that researches sleep cycles in humans agree with.

If we keep DST, most European regions won't have a sunrise until 10 AM in December.|||This is plain bad advice. You do not take counselling *with* your abuser (and he is most definitely mentally and physically abusing her). By all means, she should get counselling on her own, but not *with* him. Bit of text from the domestic violence hotline website explaining why:In order for couples counseling to be successful, both partners must be willing to take responsibility for their actions and make adjustments to their behavior. Abusive people want all of the power and control in the relationship and will focus on maintaining that imbalance, even if it means continuing unhealthy and hurtful behavior patterns. Many callers to the Hotline have related stories of trying and “failing” at couples counseling because of an abusive partner’s focus on manipulating the sessions to place blame, minimize the abuse, and attempt to win over the therapist to their side. If the therapist tries to hold the abusive partner accountable for these tactics, they will often refuse to attend further sessions and may even forbid their partner to see the “biased” therapist again. The abusive partner may even choose to escalate the abuse because they feel their power and control was threatened.The primary reason we don’t recommend couples counseling is that **abuse is not a “relationship problem.”** Couples counseling may imply that both partners contribute to the abusive behavior, when the choice to be abusive lies solely with the abusive partner. Focusing on communication or other relationship issues distracts from the abusive behavior, and may actually reinforce it in some cases. Additionally, a therapist may not be aware that abuse is present and inadvertently encourage the abuse to continue or escalate.|||There is quite some research being done on human circadian rhythm (essentially your natural sleep/wake cycle). There are two dimensions to sleep: the *amount* of sleep (hours) and the time during the day when your circadian rhythm tells you you *should* sleep. Obviously, most people fall in the typical 8 hours from about 11 pm to 7 am, but like many things, it really is a spectrum. There are people who honestly only need 4 hours of sleep and be just as well rested (and healthy) as those who sleep 8 hours. There are also people who *need* 12 hours of sleep to be as rested (and healthy) as those who sleep 8 hours. In the same sense, *when* your body tells you to sleep is also a spectrum. On the very extreme end of both scales you can find people who need to sleep 12 hours while their body tells them the ideal time to do so is 6 am to 6 pm (but that's rare, luckily). Boosting your productivity and sleeping according to your own internal clock go hand in hand.Obviously, your own personal circadian rhythm doesn't always align with what society (or in your case: your kids) wants you to do. Like you said, for some it's much more beneficial to sleep in later, if that's what aligns better with their internal clocks.|||Well, no. There are some night shops that sell all the basics and are open only at night, but at a 2-3x mark up from regular super market prices. One of the major super market chains has a 'to go' formula of small shops typically at train stations and such, which are open from 6 till midnight, but also sell at a mark up. The regular neighbourhood places are not open 24/7. I wouldn't be surprised if this was actually against the law even and they couldn't be open 24/7 even if they wanted to. Seems like something the government would regulate in the Netherlands.|||Nee hoor, je leest het correct. Er is een maximum wat DUO per maand maar vragen voor de terugbetaling, namelijk 4% van je inkomen BOVEN minimumloon. Wij hebben grofweg 2x 70k studieschuld.

Dat zou dus betekenen dat we 330 euro per maand moeten betalen om de originele schuld, zonder rente, te moeten betalen. 330/0.04 geeft je 8300 euro per maand inkomen, waar dus nog minimum loon bovenop komt.

Obviously, you won't be applying for positions that require that specific degree, because, well.. you didn't finish the degree.

Do you see yourself using your course work experience or study experience in any of the answers you'd be giving during the interview? If yes, include it, because it looks pretty shady if half way through an interview you start talking about your studies if they didn't even you were pursuing a degree to begin with.

Things like, I am interested in the computer game, but it's still a bit expensive, should I buy it? Now a few years later, I definitely know which types of games are worth the full price and which are worth nothing at all to me. One of my most recent contemplations was whether to buy a high end wireless headphone. I saved money, but put it on hold for *months* because I wasn't sure if it was worth it *for me*. I did buy it, and it definitely was as I get even more enjoyment from it than expected. But at 17, you simply don't have experience with 'stuff' to really weigh pros and cons and decide what's important to you, especially with all kinds of raging hormones in the mix which encourage impulsiveness. It's a learned skill and the only way to learn is to put effort into the learning process.|||I don't want to be harsh, but especially in creative fields, if by 27 you still don't know whether or not the creative field of your choice is your passion in life.. maybe it is not for you. I mean.. the only way to be successful and *happy* in arts these days (sadly) is if indeed your art means everything to you, because you'll need to find happiness in the art itself, not the little money you're likely to gain from your art. Especially at 25k/year for tuition alone..|||Although you are absolutely correct, lets be real: most likely his obesity is simply caused by overeating and lack of exercise. The number of people afflicted by the medically problems that actually *cause obesity* (and not just some *little* weight gain of a handfull of lbs/kg as is common with many medical conditions and treatments) is very small. If OP would suffer from Cushings or a similar disease that causes obesity, surely he would suffer from quite some other severe symptoms as well. I'm reacting specifically to your comment, because my main comment was primarily about taking responsibility for what is inside your own sphere of influence and control, opposed to trying to control that which you have no influence on. Taking care of your weight and health is definitely within your control. The concept of losing weight and increasing fitness is easy, having the determination to see it through however is difficult. By continuously bringing up 'well, it could also *just* be a medical condition' (aka it's not your fault, you can't help it) undermines this.|||I really like De Purperen Draak. It's your typically FLGS, but the owners (husband and wife) do an incredible job at actually running a good, healthy, inclusive community where shit behaviour is not tolerated. That's definitely not the case for all FLGS, so definitely check this place out.|||My dad gave me some really sound advice when I was 17-18: choose a degree that will give you a solid base and more or less guaranteed job prospects, and from that, find your niche and expertise. I went on to get an engineering degree, ended up getting an additional business degree on the side, and (without losing focus on getting through engineering), did a whole bunch of 'random' extracurriculars and additional courses in the beginning of my studies, just to get a feeling for what I like and dislike. The second half of my degree, I focuses on technology management and technology development (which resulted in my additional business degree). If you are good in math and want to do something STEM related, make this your base, as a STEM major with a solid grasp of history, economics, politics who knows what they want to do with that combination by the end of their degree, will have better position to apply for niches (and better bargaining position!)  than a history major with a solid grasp on programming. I will warn you straight away though: my business degree was way more *fun*, because it was easier, required more creativity, and the courses were just way more relaxed. My engineering was hard work and discipline, and at times, it was difficult to focus on making engineering my priority over more fun non-engineering courses. Be ready for this. |||If the risks were only to yourself, fine. But they are not. Your behaviour threatens other people on the road, as well as impacting people who witness your accidents, health care staff who have to see you die on the surgery table, people who have to deal with the clean up on the road, and most of all, all your family members... Not having a care for that 5 year old seeing you getting decapitated and splashing all your blood on their mums car windshield indeed makes you a fucking ass and idiot who is indeed low class. Enjoy your miserable life in which taking your 'calculated risk' at the cost of others is your ultimate joy.|||Thanks for the offer, I'll keep it in mind! I'll read up on the conflict of interest rules. Although, based on the criteria, it should be totally doable to write an objective (referenced) piece about someone you know. Fellowships, prizes, board positions etc are all officially announced by the mother organization, so sourcing should be easy enough.|||Not sure about the bumbs, but I've been using some pretty heavy routine that's high on antioxidant usage and it's starting to break up the redness. Never tried it on my arms though, as I really don't care about those bumbs.|||Yeah, I also went to uni in my own city and stayed home for the first year or two. Definitely didn't regret staying home, and that got me the opportunity to save the money you already have now. Even if your parents pay your tuition and give you a monthly stipend, start up costs of moving out as a student are definitely a thing. I have so many friends with money stress, and I can't stress enough how nice it was not to worry about all of that. If not moving out, this money will help get the most of your student time. If your uni or associations organizes a trip abroad: bam, go, no worries, because you got the money. Maybe you decide you want to study abroad. Bam, you've got the money already. Etc.At 16, start having this conversation with your brothers and parents! Ask them what you can expect in terms of financial assistance!|||Quick follow up on what you can actually do with regard to reducing the microplastic originating from clothing:The first is obvious, don't buy plastic clothing, and especially, don't buy polyester clothing. Look into natural fibers instead (cotton, wool, etc.)Second, if you must buy plastic clothing, do so with the intention to wear it until its natural end of life. Buy it with the intention to wear it until its a rag, and even then, use it for a while longer as a rag in cleaning your home or whatever. Fast fashion is killing this planet.  Don't participate.Third, try to buy your clothing (plastic or otherwise) second hand. Check out consignment stores, they're pretty cool! Microplastics from clothing mostly are released with the first couple of washes, so when buying second hand you're both reducing demand (lowering the production of new plastic clothes) and reduce your own footprint (also see points one and two).|||I thought I was INTJ for the longest time, also because I have a very reflective personality and because I am socially introverted. But then I realised my way of processing the world is 'outside in', not 'inside out'. I see and I observe objectively without judgement and my lightbulb moments that tell me 'of course, this is what needs to happen!' *follow* from what I see and observe. I do not try to force reality based on my inner framework of how reality *should* be (Ni, Te) but I shape reality from what it is, into what it *can* be (Te, Ni).  |||If you want to test maturity and their personal development, ask them competence related questions that test their ability for introspection: when you get an ENTJ talking about a project that they've done, ask them about how they feel about the outcomes and their role in the project, what they learned from it and how they are planning on improve themselves, and how they are fairing in that regard.Why is this important? A young, ambitious, excited ENTJ can be a bit of a bull in a china shop. If they show personal introspection, the next step is them developing introspection with regard to their relationships, which is kinda what you want in a person to build a life with. |||My baby brother (3 y.o.) apparently thinks I'm a magician mechanic. When I go to visit my family, I get to their city by train where my dad picks me up from the train station. Obviously, my brother knows that picking me up means going to see the train. One random day, the tracks were having some mechanical issue and the train was stuck. My dad told my brother that the train was broken. My baby brother commented: 'train is broken! Avacyn needs to fix it!' because obviously, whenever I visited the train worked, so I must be responsible for making sure all the trains are fixed and up and running.In the following days he saw a bunch of broken stuff. A bus with emergency lights on at the side of the road: 'bus is broken! Avacyn needs to fix it!'. A car with emergency lights on: 'car is broken! Avacyn needs to fix it!'.And then one day, they were crossing a *bridge* which opens up some times to let boats pass through. Nothing wrong with the damn bridge though. Except according to my brother. The bridge being down meant there weren't any boats around, which *obviously* means the boats must be broken. So as they passed the bridge, my brother said: 'boat is broken! Avacyn needs to fix it!'. |||I can imagine some more advanced first aid courses could come in handy in your case! I agree on the dual citizenship. Same story for me. Obviously, I don't want to haul my passports around everywhere I go (the chance of needing them is lower than the chance of losing them an having to deal with the aftermath), but I do plan to have copies of my passports and birth certificates in my BOB.|||I asked my GP about it. They told me it's not covered by insurance, but if I want it, just to book an appointment with their nurse who is specialized in vaccinations etc and she'll arrange my inoculation for rabies and any other additional vaccinations I might want (I'm thinking about getting some boosters for my childhood innoculations, as well as HepA and HepB). It comes out of pocket though. In my country, the total cost for the 3 shots + the visits themselves would come to a total of ~150 euros.|||Yes, US allows dual citizenship. The EU has a long standing treaty to reduce multiple nationalities, but considering the history of the US, they never had reason to do the same. I was more thing in lines of how getting a US visa might be easier with a UK nationality, opposed to Lithuanian. I'm not sure about this, but I can definitely imagine the US and UK having additional agreements which Lithuania is lacking. In that case though, I would suggest contacting the US embassy with the question. And even *if* it turns out to be easier with UK citizenship, your GF can decide to apply once she's actually planning to go to the US. This gives her time to sit out Brexit and its consequences. |||If you are considering continuing in academia, you might for example consider coming to the Netherlands. You would have the creds to start out as an assistant professor on some kind of tenure track system. At my uni, that would give you a 5 year employee contract (which you don't need to fund yourself). After those 5 years you go up for promotion and provided your teaching and fund acquisition was good enough during those 5 years, you get full tenure. My uni also regularly holds open calls for talented female staff and has set aside additional funds specifically to appoint female tenure track staff. Not sure if there are positions open right now though, but as you still have a year to go, that might be an option. I'm sure other Dutch unis have similar programmes.|||Lefier and MVGM are two that come to mind. You could also look for advertisements on either Funda or Pararius and check which company is renting out the properties you're interested in.|||I admittedly don't know a lot about Muslim religion and culture, but I know that in many Christian religions, it's quite common to have missionary missions to spread religion and convince people to convert. Does Islam have something similar? There might be a SA based organization that organizes these trips outside of the country. You need to remember: the MOMENT you step food outside of SA, you can't be touched anymore, because of your UK citizenship. If you were a SA national, things would be different, but the fact that you are a UK citizen will be your ticket out of this. What about devout Muslim family members abroad? Any weddings/funerals, whatever coming up? Any excuse to visit family?|||Shouldn't be too hard to make yourself, right? I would try buying a ice cube tray and pour the Jello in those to make small cubes/spheres like in the gif. |||That's my point. If the only difference between the demographic having a serious eating disorder and the morbidly obese demographic is *perceived* distress by the individual in that demographic... That's pretty damn bad.|||Dear u/shaifnan, I have removed your post as per rule 2 (stationary).I'll answer both your PM question and the reason for removal here. r/bujo is a sub that's focused on the use of the bujo system as a productivity tool. You asked about the automated PM you got from us: one of the rules on this sub is that every one who posts a picture post, must post a comment as well to discuss how what they show in their picture is related to productivity. This is done to ensure the content on this sub is always about the use of bujo's and to help the other people of this sub with how to get most out of their own bujo. You can find the full set of rules on the sidebar or on the sticky post on the r/bujo frontpage. One this that's not allowed on this sub (because it's not about using a bujo as a productivity tool) are photos of cover pages, drawing, or.. like in your case, stationary (notebook, pens, etc.). For this reason, your post was removed. Have a look at the sidebar! We've composed a list of related subreddits which might offer a more suitable place for your content.|||Well, ideally, especially if it's your SO, you've been spending a lot of time with them in non-stress or minor stress situations building your relationship and discussing communication and support methods within your relationship.By the time your SO is in major distress, you should know how your SO likes to be supported in times like these and you do exactly that. |||Im an ENTJ with an INTJ friend. We are actually quite similar in our thinking but the reasoning is opposite. I can look at a system (an organization, a case, a product development cycle, whatever) and see holes and inefficiencies in that system (my Te at work), which is then superimposed by my Ni that has developed a certain ideal vision for the system I'm working on, and that's when a lightbulb goes of thinking for example 'shit, if we do this and this, we're connecting these seemingly unrelated parts in this system, creating a new synergy that not only is satisfying my personal agenda, but also fits the policy set out by management and will make everything run more efficient overall.' My INTJ  friend is much more inside out. They have spend most of their life creating a solid Ni frame of mind of what is important and what 'should' be, and what 'should' be gets superimposed by 'what is' (their Te) to find how most efficiently and effectively change the what is to the what should be. This is why there is also such a large difference in how far ENTJ vs INTJ looks towards the future, as ENTJ are more focused on reacting to the present (they need a system to work on to begin with), while INTJ are more focused on the long term game as they are not bound by a system to trigger their dominant function. Both are extremely future focused (you will not find an NTJ without an ever adapting multiyear plan), but the time horizon for INTJ are even way way longer.|||I think your story is a great example about how preparations need to be tailor specifically to your and your family's situation with regard to risk factor and specific needs. I love your story about your dogs. I have cat so prepping for my single cat definitely isn't the same compared to a pack of hunting dogs (damn.) but it's definitely something that needs to be accounted for in prepping for emergencies.|||I think I was pretty average. I'm Dutch, so our culture is quite sexually open to begin with, and looking back, I think I was raised pretty sex positively. I never really discussed sex with my parents, but (especially my father!) they have always been very open about relationships, gender/sexuality, and asserting my own boundaries. About seeing value: I have considered the idea of being asexual, but came to the conclusion I wasn't. Rather, my sexuality was influenced a lot my my mental state, so if I had periods of extreme stress or sadness, my sexuality went out of the window. Maybe your girlfriend is simply in an emotional (long term) bad spot? I know I have been through moments like these without realizing it, until my SO went to sit me down to work it through together. If she is truly uninterested in sex and the intimacy from sex and will not be able to come to a compromise, that again would be a very valid point to reconsider your relationship. I mean, even for me - someone who is not very sexual at all - it is still important, and would still be a deal breaker. It's important to discuss deal breakers with your SO. I have had many of these conversations with mine, during those evening chats. For example, I want to have an expat life. I have told my SO from day one, you need to be able to deal with it and be supportive of this lifestyle, because I'm not budging on it. Or another important one: I am highly ambitious, while my SO is more laid back (maybe a *liiiiitle* bit lazy even). I told him that for me, a key component of a relationship is continuous growth. If he would spend his time only sitting at home and gaming, I *will* leave him. I don't care what he does to challenge himself (hell, for all I care he'll start a course on Chinese calligraphy), but continuous growth is important. I have a few more, and likewise, he has a couple of these deal breakers as well (one of which includes his sexual satisfaction). We know this of each other, and it provides a strong foundation to work on our relationship.I would recommend anyone to spend some significant time *on their own* and actually write down for themselves what it is you find important in a relationship and what values/outlooks/agreements you can simply not live without. This is the part of the taking in my give and take argument in my first post.Our moment together is not exclusively about sex though, or even exclusively about our relationship. We talk about anything. For example, if I'm sad about some stupid shit a friend of mine did, I'll discuss it. If I felt stressed that day for no apparent reason, I'll discuss it. etc. Same goes for him. I don't see how you can control communication if you communicate in 'I sentences'. Talk about you and your feelings, let her talk about hers, and at all time, focus on what *you* can do to change for the better. You might have noticed that in the 3 points I mentioned in the first post, all of them relate to me and my actions. Of course, it's not only me working on the issue, my SO has a similar list of his own. The thing is, I can only be responsible for *my* role in the relationship, so I don't claim ownership or responsibility for how my SO contributes. You seem to do this naturally as well:If you'd discuss this topic with your SO, you can approach this two ways. The first would be telling her how you'd like HER to 'reject' you, and the other would be asking her how you can change your approach in terms of timing, or how you ask it. Focus on you, let her focus on her. If she is not willing to focus on her own behaviour (not only with sex, but in general), again, that would be something that is seriously detrimental to your long term relationship, and a reason to reconsider.This for me would be a serious discussion topic in our relationship. The step between asking 'do you want to have sex?' and her feeling pressured to have sex due to that question is **not** normal, and **not** healthy. There is something going on her for her mentally that needs to be investigated to the core, either between the two of you, of for her to go see a therapist. (My SO and I are very easy and open about seeking therapy, it's incredibly important to take care of your mental health!) Exactly, you shouldn't need to be afraid, because in a good relationship with strong communication skills and plenty of self knowledge, you would simply be able to discuss 'how can I communicate better to not make you pressured?', 'how can she show you better that she is feeling pressured in that specific moment?'. This is not about sex, again, it's about communication. My SO and I had an issue in which I would push my SO too much verbally when I was feeling is was not being open enough about his mental state. I would keep asking questions, keep poking, which made him really uncomfortable, stressed, and in some emotional states, even feel aggressive because he felt attacked. We now have a rule which states that at any time during our discussions, my SO can simply say 'Avacyn, stop.' and I'd shut my mouth that very instant, while he would articulate what he needed to take some space. 'I am going to take a walk for 10 minutes.', 'I want to watch some TV', etc. This all came with the agreement that the 'stop.' argument could in no case be the end of the discussion, and it would be **his** job to restart the discussion *as soon as* he'd feel comfortable and calm enough again. I'm not saying you need to do the same, but you two need to find a way to actually communicate. She does not get to say a few days after the fact that she felt pressured, without being willing to discuss why it happened, how it happened, and how to deal with it in the future. Simply blaming you for pressuring her somehow is gas lighting and manipulative in my book, because its only purpose in that case is to make you feel bad. Yes, you have the responsibility to not pressure her, but it's also her responsibility to indicate that she feels pressured.I think we are the ones that are actually alike in this case, in terms of assertiveness. Also see my point above. My point above stands, if your SO feels you have controlling tendencies, you need to figure out a way to communicate about this. The 'Avacyn, stop.' argument is a good example. Also, I don't think you are very pressuring when it comes to sex, at least, based from your writings. You have stated several times that as soon as she says no, you back off, and you are very firm on her not having to explain herself and accepting a no for what it is. This to me tells me you are not controlling, quite the opposite.My SO is not pressuring me, because like you, he understands that no is no, and he actively asks questions for me to answer. He's not a mind reader though, so I can't expect him to just magically know when I don't want to do something or him to ask about every little contingency. I need to use my own voice to express myself.My SO has a very specific way in how the dishes need to be organized in the kitchen. And a few of other weird things. It's a bit annoying, but seriously /care, it's not that big of a deal to store dishes in place B, instead of A. This point goes back to the list of core values I talked about before. Both of you can be amazing, loving people with a lot of potential, but these core values need to align and need to have a shared support. If not, you are simply not meant for each other.|||Please don't take this the wrong way, but reading through all your comments on this thread... you come across as being a bit dramatic. You are only making things harder on yourself if you consider this journey to be 'climbing the Everest'. You didn't lose the weight last time *because* you were physically active. You lost weight because you ate less calories than you ended up using. You don't need to set a single step to lose weight. These 'uphill battles' are won in the kitchen and in chosing what you put in your mouth. Today is no different. There is no Everest, and this is nothing you haven't done before. You got this. |||Step 1. Be a good student with a strong work ethic.Step 2. Get professors to like you.Step 3. Have multiple professors approach you every other month begging you to become a teaching assistant for their course.I pick the courses I like best and set my terms in number of hours I want to get compensated for (regardless of if I actually spend that many hours working) and which/how many tutorial classes in a course I want to teach. TAs are paid really, really well at my university (even if you are only paid the actual hours you're putting in). Also, it's a very nice addition to your resume. |||When I look at my long term INTP partner, he is very much traditionally masculine: he's tall, works out a lot (combat sports, weights) making him physically strong, he's very protective of me, he likes working with his hands and fix stuff around the house, and he's quite dominant in the bedroom. But in no way is he jealous, or overbearing, or aggressive, or pushy, or any other typical stereotypical alpha male behaviour. On the other hand, my man is also: kind, caring, and in touch with his emotions. He's a very good listener and a good helper, both to me and his (male and female) friends. He is honest, calm, trustworthy, and patient. He's just as secure about his masculine traits as he is about his more feminine traits. That sense of security about himself and his character is what makes him an amazing partner in life and is why our relationship is working out so well, but his more masculine traits made him (sexually) attractive to me. He he was the typical alpha male.. hard pass.|||I think I was a bit older (but not much) before I got into it. Especially as I'm not from an English speaking country, so to follow along, I needed some English proficiency under my belt as well. I was probably around 10 when I started getting really into it.  Before star trek, my dad got me into console gaming and made sure I always had several unread books to read. I read a lot of (at that time) modern fantasy childrens books, which are also a domain in which girls are generally portrayed as very much kick ass. Also, I remember building a robot together, and he helped decorating the stupid think with pretty pink stickers.I think the biggest thing he did for me was not to get me to like 'boy stuff' but to really challenge me to always ask questions, push me to be a critical thinker and form my own opinions, and he **always** rewarded my curiosity by setting out to find answers to my questions together. He would never push my questions aside or give me a stupid non answer. He'd always take an interest and take time to answer me. He always vocalized how it was a good question, and would encourage me to come up with follow up questions after I thought through his answers a bit more. If possible, he took my questions as a sign of interest in a certain topic and would suggest activities based on my questions.For example, if I would ask him about why certain plants could survive in the shade and others couldn't, he'd explain it to me, and he would follow up by asking if I'd be interested to run a little experiment together in our back yard to see if we can check that answer.This had nothing to do with gender norms or girl stuff vs boy stuff. This has everything to do with cultivating curiosity and getting me to think on my own.|||I really get fed up with posts like these about 'everybody can be a morning person, it's just a matter of *willpower*!'.Science tells you: it's not and for many people, it's unhealthy.I love how you post a link about circadian rhythm, and although the advice is cool, they fail to mention a key point of circadian rhythms: natural (genetic!) variation in1. the amount of sleep (number of hours) an individual needs according to their circadian rhythm2. the moment during the day an individual needs to sleep according to their circadian rhythm.Want to use sleep to become more productive? Make sure you sleep according to your own clock.Sure, the 'average' person (as in \\\\*most\\\\* people) sleep their 8 hours from somewhere around 10-12 pm to 6-8 am, but that doesn't mean anything for you as an individual. There are people who naturally only need 4 hours as sleep and those who naturally need 10+ hours of sleep to both be as well rested as the 'average' person that needs 8 hours. There are some people who's optimum sleeping time will be early in the evening and who wake up early in the morning, but also people who's optimal sleeping time is early mornings running in to early afternoons.Telling people to become a morning person (especially if they are natural night owls) as a catch all is just... irresponsible. Anyway, if you want to learn more, you can google for 'chronotype' and related research.|||Omdat je met deze bedragen aan studieschuld je simpelweg niet het hele bedrag gáát afbetalen in 15 jaar. Als je schuld kleiner is, zeg 10k en je kunt dit eerder afbetalen waardoor je er na 5 jaar (ik zeg maar wat) geen last van hebt in plaats van 15 jaar, dan valt er wat voor te zeggen. In dat geval betaal je aan het eind alles toch en scheelt het je rente. Dat is echter niet realistisch met dergelijke hoge schuld. Je hebt er dus nul profijt van om meer te betalen dan waar DUO om vraagt. Aan het eind van de rit zit je dan alsnog op 15 jaar en wordt de restschuld kwijtgescholden, en dan heb je meer betaald dan nodig, geld dat je ook had kunnen beleggen bijvoorbeeld om het gat tussen hypotheek en eigen vermogen te dekken als je wel besluit je studieschuld op te geven bij hypotheek aanvraag. |||Ik ben deel van een stel in jouw leeftijdscategorie waarbij we allebei een dergelijke studieschuld hebben (en mijn vriend een soortgelijke achtergrond heeft als jij wat betreft mentale gezondheid).Een ding moet je je echt per direct realiseren: die studieschuld is *echt* niet zo eng als het lijkt. Er is overigens een groot voordeel aan jouw situatie, waar mijn vriend ook achter is gekomen. Je 'terugbetaal' periode start 2 jaar nadat je geen RECHT meer hebt op studiefinanciering, niet na je afstuderen. Mijn vriend heeft de laatste 2 jaar van z'n studie volledig zelf bekostigd uit spaargeld omdat hij geen lening meer kon krijgen.. als ik jouw tijdlijn volg, zat je misschien in dezelfde situatie. Na die 2 jaar, wordt je inkomen gepeild op het jaar dat je moet terugbetalen minus 2. In het geval van mijn vriend was dat dus terwijl hij nog student was en geen (groot) inkomen had. Dit betekent dat de eerste 2 van de 15 jaar DUO heel leuk zegt: je inkomen is 0 en daarom hoef je niks terug te betalen dit jaar. Boem, plotseling ben je weer een paar jaar dichterbij kwijtschelding van je schuld. Dit effect blijf je houden over de loop van je carriere, waarbij je peiljaar eigenlijk altijd 2 jaar achterloopt op je carrieregroei. Relatief betaal je dan weinig terug.Nog iets om in de gaten te houden: als je geen recht meer hebt op lening, kun je je studiekosten opvoeren als aftrekpost bij je aangiften, dit telt ook op!Aangezien je de komende 5 jaar behoorlijk wat veranderingen verwacht die mogelijk aardig wat geld gaan kosten, raad ik je vooral aan om je geld niet per se te gaan beleggen, maar simpelweg te sparen. Ik heb hier een tweede reden voor.. gezien je een aantal turbulente, zware jaren achter de rug hebt, gaat het misschien ook mentaal beter voor je zijn om het vrij beschikbaar te hebben op een spaarrekening ipv in beleggingen. Nu sparen zodat je t.z.t. zonder zorgen kunt zeggen 'ik kan verhuizen/samenwonen/een huis kopen/een paar maanden thuis zitten om een andere baan te vinden/wat dan ook' omdat je *weet* dat je het geld hebt .. gaat je erg veel rust opleveren. Zodra je in rustiger vaarwater zit kun je dat spaargeld alsnog beleggen.. ja, mogelijk raak je een paar honderd euro / 1-2 duizend euro kwijt aan opportunity cost voor de misgelopen groei.. maar hey, dat is die rust het echt wel waard na alles wat je hebt meegemaakt.Edit: nog een dingetje... vooral DUO niet meer gaan terugbetalen dan waar ze naar vragen...|||Seems you worked out a balance that's  healthy and comfortable for you. Maybe something to think about, as I recognize it in myself a bit as well, but you obviously have some obsessive tendencies. Probably, these obsessive tendencies do not just cover MBTI. It might be good for you to do some introspection to figure out what qualities and aspects of MBTI triggered the obsessive reading and learning behaviour. Could be useful in general to do such an assementent so you're aware of either other topics in your life that might need attention, or to make you realize in an early stage you are starting to be obsessive again about something else.|||That last one is key.... especially if you want to get a masters degree in the EU, you might find it difficult to get accepted because of the  setup of liberal arts degrees.

Don't be like the international student last year who went chasing the dragon and fell out of his windows 10+ floors up because no one in his group was sober and able to stop him.|||I mean.. do you have a company phone? Good example of how 'volunteer' programs are riddled with power dynamics.Think about the social expectation of leaving your company phone on during evenings and weekends in case somebody needs to contact you for a quick question. Sure, maybe getting the phone is voluntary, and sure, you *can* turn it off at the end of your working day, but can you truly due the power dynamics present? Now consider the option that your company likely has remote access to this phone and all its data. And consider the amount of data this phone is gathering on you and your private life. Right to privacy? My arse.Now extrapolate that to getting chipped through a 'voluntary' program and what this would mean to your right  to bodily autonomy (which I personally consider leagues and leagues more important than the right to privacy, which is also *very* high up there for me to begin with).|||I never had much issue throwing stuff out, because I continually ask myself: 'do I want/need this item in *my* life going into the future? Does it add value to *my* life?' No? Then it needs to leave asap, because it's just taking needless energy from me by this item being in my life. |||I really don't know how to feel about BMI. When I was serious overweight at  about BMI 32 my waist to hip was still perfectly within range for women my age. I'm now at BMI 28 and my waist to hip keeps shrinking. For me to hit a BMI of about 20-21 I need to loose another 20 kg. When I look at myself in the mirror, I seriously don't know where the weight needs to come from, or whether I even want to loose that much in terms of physical attractiveness. Another 10 sure, no probs, but 20... it's seriously confusing to me at times.|||I disagree. If you want to continue in academia it does matter if you got your PhD in Oxford. Why? Because it shows you got in either through really good contacts or by being a seriously impressive student. Both are important qualities for future professors. Also, it shows you were able to find funding for your PhD (as oxbridge require own funding to a certain extent) which again, is a very important quality towards a professorship.I've been part of selection committees and promotion committees at my top 100 uni, and although it won't necessarily guarantee you a position if your other work is crap, it definitely does stick out and will help you get through CV selection. |||You bring up a really important point. This is probably also why I had a hard time thinking of scenarios in which I'd actually had a proper use of my BOB. I do think there is merit to one for the situations I discussed in my post (middle of the night evac mostly) and a BOB can also be useful in other emergency situation, even if I can't get to it. For example, in the case of a medical emergency, I can head strait to the hospital without my bag and if I'm told it'll be a long night, I can ask my SO to bring my bag to the hospital, knowing I'll have everything I need for a few days in it.I don't own a car. My day to day is all near my home (max. 1 hour walking distance), but I agree in terms of emergency preparedness, it will likely be far more useful to have a car kit if your day to day takes you further from home and further from established infrastructure.|||Read up on functions a bit more.

That's what PR looks like in practice. |||I can be really short about this: if I'm ill, fuck the company, my health has priority. Any employment is build on the premise that they pay you less than the worth you're adding to the company. I've been adding value to the company throughout the year, so if I have to take a few days (or even a week or 2) off to recover and ensure my personal health is taken care of, I will do so. They pay me for my added value, not for my life. I don't even have to feel 'like utter dog shit' to stay home. I know my body. If I feel a serious flu coming up, I will stay home *before* it's caught up with me 100%, because I know, if I take a rest now, I'll get a lot less ill later on. Again, my health has priority.I also live in a country with good worker protection rights, so they literally can't fire me for being ill (even long term illness) and I don't have to justify my illness to my employee, only to an independent GP. So, the employee can fuck right off, I'll be staying home.|||I think there is a massive difference as well between having your phone on hand and having a quick look if you get a text/WhatsApp message from someone (a thing that's directed at you as an individual, from another individual), versus checking 'social media'. I would think it's pretty rude to randomly start scrolling on FB or whatever when you're one on one with someone. Also, just checking a message in itself is something different compared to starting whole conversations with another individual. To me its fine to answer a quick question from somebody, or to let them know you're unavailable right now in a situation OP describes, but don't start texting back and forth every couple of minutes..|||Puberty sounds good, but I would start way, way earlier when it comes to sun protection.My mum wouldn't make me put on sun screen every day when I was small, but if I would go out to play in the sun during spring or summer, she would make make sure I was wearing sun screen. She taught when it was important to reapply and how to do so. When I went on school day trips, she always put a bottle of sun screen in my bag and ask me to reapply during the day. And I did.I literally don't know what it's like *not* to use sun protection religiously because it's always been so normal for me to do so. Already in my 20s my skin is so much better off than my sun worshipping friends who absolutely got their skin wrecked during their teenage years. By now, I actually do use sun screen daily on my face, even in winter, as my mother has been telling me to do ever since I was about 15-16 (but of course, I didn't listen to her back then).|||Dear u/maximuspovver, your post has been removed as per rule 2: Post that focus on non-productivity related content/topics will be removed (incl. **cover pages**, drawings, stationery, etc.).|||You are already 10% there! If you need it by your fourth year, definitely don't invest it. Leave it on a savings account.|||I have been toying with a similar idea for a sub I moderate. One thing I was worried about is the amount of effort required to nominate people. It's quite a bit to ask for people to write a full nomination letter + 3 separate links. Also, you have to be *very* involved in the community to recognize recurring users names and remember those users for being high value contributors. It's still in the 'ideas' phase, but one thing I was thinking about is using the report functionality to give users an easy way to get high quality content known to the mods. Make a 'hidden' rule for this purpose and have the report function say something like 'nominate this user for top contributor'. Behind the scenes you could keep count / make a tally to see if certain names pop up multiple times.This way makes it quick and easy to participate, even for more lurking members who aren't super deep into this community. Sure, it's anonymous, and self-nomination might be an issue, but really, I think the patterns would be very obvious when it comes to self-nomination. Maybe this is something that could work on this sub as well. If you decide to go this route, please let me know. I would be very interested to hear about your experience.|||Dear OP, your post has been removed as per rule 2.

I'm a lurker on quite a few artists subs and although there are plenty of artists, very few offer something that's both beautiful as well as being their own unique style.I looked through your social media pages. Your style would look amazing when printed on wall paper, having it covering entire walls. That's what I would do at least. |||If you getting your bachelor degree from an internationally recognized university, don't worry about being able to get into a masters programme in Europe. Sure, places like ETH are highly selective, but many amazing, top notch universities in Europe simply only require you to proof you have acquired a bachelor education of equivalent equality as their own bachelor programmes to get into a masters.Start making lists of universities you'd like to attend, and if it gives you some peace of mind, you can already start contacting them with questions regarding admission criteria etc. Also start reading up on visa requirements. For example, tuition in Germany is low, but you'd need to have a proof of funds to get a visa, which means you essentially need to be able to show a bank statement with at least a 9k euro balance on it. If that's something that will be a problem for you or your family, you need to start making plans now while you still have time on how to solve that problem.|||I like that advice. It gives somewhat of 'objective measurements' to judge quality of life. It's difficult though, because you're essentially making the *choice* to end a life, even though the cat will still be very much 'alive'. If I have to judge our cat, the first will be definitely eating. Damn this cat enjoys eating. I seriously did not know a cat could eat this much. When we got him he was really tiny, now he finally has a decent weight and actually looks healthy again. The second would be running around like *crazy* at night. The cat is 16, but definitely could keep up with hyperactive kittens. The third would be his constant begging for hugs and attention and constant kneading. I'll think of a few more.|||There have been a handful of studies claiming toxicity... and probably over a hundred (at least) that showed those results weren't supported. The anti-paraben movement is one big marketing ploy and really has no scientific backing whatsoever. I happily use parabens: my current moisturizer has parabens for example and I use it happily.Your comment about reproducibility is a tough one in this case. In general, you are correct, although methodology is pretty strict when it comes to medical sciences. Also, you can't proof a negative. If study after study shows *no* carcinogenic/estrogenic effects, there is nothing to actually reproduce. That's probably why your link is about refuting papers that say that GMO *are* harmful, instead of arguing that papers that argue they are *not* harmful are providing actual proof for that fact. |||Seriously. I wouldn't only call the fertility clinic to cancel the appointment, I would also call the hospital to demand to be put in the care of another doctor. I would not want to be treated by a doctor who does not respect your choices with regard to your own medical and bodily autonomy. |||Been in this position myself. If you're in lots of pain and high on heavy pain meds, interaction sometimes got too much and I definitely had days when I just wanted to sleep and not see anyone. Having company in this state is draining energy which you don't have. I once told my mom 5 minutes in she had to leave because it was too much.I did want my long term SO with me daily during that time, but I had days he would just sit next to me, holding my hand, without saying anything because I couldn't even manage a short conversation.Just saying: being hospitalized does not come with a neon message sigh that says 'i need people to visit me'. Ask beforehand, and if the patient tells you no, listen to them.|||Hold on.. E definitely does *not* mean you get energized from being around people. E in the MBTI type shows how people process the world: extroverts look outside in, while introverts look inside out, so to say. Whether you get energized by social interaction in the more colloquial sense of extraversion/introversion has nothing to do with having I or E as type.I really recommend you look into functions a bit more. Especially when it comes to ENTJ, this distinction is important. Even though we are E types, many of us are *extremely* socially introverted and find social interaction very draining. It's rather typical for ENTJs being known as the most introverted of the E-types. So much even, that when I hear somebody say they are extremely socially extraverted and self type as ENTJ, I'm quick to doubt whether they are not an ESTP or something instead.|||Any chance you're American? I notice these behaviours from the Americans in my study programme as well: the need for continuous, insincere bullshit because God forbid we acknowledge not everything is 100% positive in life. I guess it's a cultural thing.. and it does not mix well with my own Dutch cultural need for directness. |||The Netherlands (and if I remember correctly, also Germany and Scandivian countries) have a similar system in which main funding comes from the state itself. All of these countries are top 10 in the Corroption Perceptions Index. In the Netherlands, companies are allowed to donate to campaigns. However, political parties need to provide a full insight into their financing to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and political parties need to track exactly where every donated euro comes from. Every year, the minister will publish a public overview of any individual (mentioning full names, etc) who have donated more than 4500 euros. If I remember correctly, this month a new law was passed which excludes any foreign person or company to fund political parties, and to lower the threshold of name publication to 2500 euros. |||What's the highest score of paspoort combinations you've come across?

I wouldn't berate anyone for not knowing this stuff and it should be talked about more often to share information and awareness. Before I went to my GP, I was actually thinking the same, because I figured it would make sense that since I've been on BC since my teens and only menstruate maybe 3 times a year, I wouldn't go through an early menopause like my mum because I 'have more eggs left'. Yeah. Doesn't work like that. My GP said the genetic factor is really strong, and if my mum went through early menopause, I should really just assume I will as well. |||If this is your concern not to tell him.. you have bigger issues than just this business card. I definitely would tell my long term SO. I would probably say something like: 'something really funny happened, I got handed this card by this random guy while I was on the phone with you.' And my SO would probably react by having a laugh about it, high-fiving me because 'of course you would get hit on, you're gorgeous babe, you know that right?', followed by a stupid joke asking me whether the guy was cute and whether or not he needs to go after the guy and be all 'hurr, durr, that's my girl and you stay away from her' about it.And it would probably come up in the months after in jokes between the two of us and our friends when we talk about our relationship like: 'well, did you keep that number, maybe you should ask the guy out anyway!'If something silly and cute like this would cause drama in your relationship... pfiew.. there must be a lot of drama. |||Yup.

Also, you just discovered the secret to happiness in life:There are so many people here who hated themselves when fat, who hated themselves when they were losing weight, and - surprise - still hate themselves once they hit their goal weight. But that's **not** you. You've already learned that you are deserving of self-love even if you're not at your perfect weight yet. Let self-love be the motivator of why you are losing weight, not your wedding pictures! This is also why when you'll look back at your photos in maybe a year or two when you've reached your goal weight, you won't hate your pictures, as you had happiness in life at both weights.|||I've thought about this too, but it has its drawbacks: this sub does have a decently sized user base that actually *did* subscribe because of the productivity related content, and - more importantly - even though the 'pretty stuff' is getting more and more traction, this sub is still attracting *a lot* of high quality, on topic content. Getting a new sub with the same kind and volume of high quality content would be far more difficult than simply weeding out the off-topic content in this sub.|||Here's a link to the Dutch immigration branch of the government which exactly outlines which type of jobs qualify for a work visa: https://ind.nl/werk/Paginas/Werknemer.aspxAs you'll see: The Netherlands only allows highly educated or specialists to immigrate.I'm a Dutch graduate student in both Industrial Engineering and Supply Chain Management: you are right, the market is pretty good for both and should qualify for visas. There are some things you should know about this field though. Both IE and SCM are 'academic' fields, meaning you need to get a degree from a *university* to actually be employable and get the kind of salary to get a visa. In the Netherlands, university students are more or less expected to get a masters degree. It's (very) uncommon to stop after a bachelors, due to our tiered educational system. Instead of a university bachelor graduate (3 year degree), employers rather would higher an bachelor of applied sciences graduate (4 year degree) who has more practical/vocational experience. Another thing: US associates degrees mostly are not acknowledged in Europe and you need a degree from a reputable US university to get entry into a Dutch university master programme. The topic of US college degrees not being recognized in the Netherlands as 'university level educations' comes up pretty regularly on this sub.  For both these fields: I really recommend doing your masters over here. Additional bonus when you take this route is the possibility to get a 'job seeker' visa after graduating that allows you to stay in the country for a year (?) to look for a job and get an employment visa. However, it's not cheap to get your masters over here as an American. Also, you need to make sure your bachelors degree will qualify for entry in a Dutch masters programme in those fields. You could already email some Dutch uni's to get some feedback on this. If your current college won't qualify, you might want to transfer at one point. (Oh, and academic transfers are also not a thing in Europe/Netherlands, so transferring from your current bachelor degree to a Dutch bachelor degree isn't feasible. They'll just tell you to do the whole degree over here instead.)|||You're looking at the wrong websites with the wrong type of 'business' clothing. We are young enough to be able to pull of crazy colours and prints, while still looking professional.I have a rule in my life: dress as if you could suddenly be pulled into a business meeting without expecting it all, and not feel *totally* out of place in terms of how you look. Of course, there is a difference in how formal different industries are. I'm not talking about the law and banking business, that's another thing all together. But I'll give some examples that would work in professional, but not necessarily formal industries (which is the massive majorty, outside of law and banking).That doesn't mean black pencil skirt and black blazer. It could mean bright, bold colours, but in a shape or cut that is a bit more traditionally formal. Or the other way around, something subdued, but with very interesting, uncommon shapes and cuts. I love this [dress](https://topvintage.nl/nl/vintage-retro/50s-vedette-swing-dress-in-raspberry-pink) for example, which is a lot brighter and bolder in colour irl compared to the pictures. Pair it with some classic black pumps, and you have a super colourful, happy outfit, which looks put together and professional due to cut and length. This is [another](https://www.claudiastrater.com/active-elegance-023.html) super colourful dress, that would still look very put together and professional, especially at a younger age.I also love traditional blouses and blazers, in non-traditional colours. See this [outfit](https://www.cavallaronapoli.com/nl/nerola-75035) for example. I don't like sneakers, and for my personal style, this would be too casual, but still, if you'd be pulled in an unexpected meeting, this outfit would still kick ass. Love the green pastel colour. What about a [jumpsuit](https://images.hugoboss.com/is/image/boss/hbeu50380514_301_21?$re_fullPageZoom$&amp;wid=1500&amp;hei=2275) in a pretty colour? You can always combine it with a blazer of cardigen that fits the shape of the jumpsuit well, and there you go. Ready to take on the world.Also, don't underestimate how a bold outfit can still fit in a lot of situation, even if it doesn't fit the stereotype, as long as you wear it with confidence, stand straight, and claim your space. |||Congrats! Yeah, the exact procedure depends on the degree programme. I'm not sure about arts, but at science and engineering (at least the graduations I went through/witnessed), the graduation ceremonies are BSc/MSc combined with set dates a couple of times a year and are held at the Senate Chambers at the academy building (the one with all the portraits). The chair of the exam committee will call you forward, comment on how well you did during your degrees (and maybe note some specific achievements such as committee or board work, publications, etc if you have them) and ask you to officially sign your diploma, usually the thesis supervisor gives a small speech about the student as well before you sign. You sign your diploma and sit back down again. Usually there are about 20-30 students graduating at the time (maybe a bit more in the autumn, as most students who are on track officially graduate in August of course). All in all, the ceremony takes about ~2 ish hours. Afterwards, there is a big 'borrel' for all students and their families at the academy building or nearby, paid for by the faculty. Afterwards, people typically go out for dinner with their family. At economics and business, it's different for MSc graduations, as it's a more private affair at their Faculty Chamber in the academy building, with also your thesis supervisor being there to speech and congratulate you on your achievement.Either way, tenue de ville is definitely the way to go! You won't graduation robes, but do make sure to take your picture on the Academy Building stairs holding your diploma. That one's a classic!|||The shopkeeper is most likely just an idiot. That being said, the Dutch  are very unaccomodating to Dutch language learners. The thing is, it's not really an identity thing in my opinion. It just... you've heard the stereotype of Dutch being extremely direct. Which is true. But this directness comes from an absolute *need* for efficiency. From a 'typical Dutch perspective' it just does not make sense to have both people struggle because one of them doesn't speak the language very well if both speak English. It's just more efficient to simply handle that shop transaction in English, so let's speak English. Our goal is to finish this transaction, you are fucking up our shared efficiency by trying to speak Dutch, so we are going to switch to English, because that's the more efficient approach. It makes sense, and because it's more efficient, by (Dutch) definition, it cannot be rude to do so. Actually: we would consider it very rude if the non-Dutch speaker would *continue* to try and struggle with Dutch, holding up the line for other people waiting to pay for their stuff. You are bothering them and causing them to spend their time inefficiently by being stubborn. *That's* rude. |||Yes, you did mention it, but I read past in originally, making me only realize so when this person commented about it.

But this piece advice was definitely *not* sexist. |||Not arc system, but might fit your needs anyway: Kokuyo has a ring bound system with teeny tiny rings (in both A and B sizing). |||Girl - I'm not oblivious at all. Not all of us live in the US and there are countries where infrastructure is available to protect it's citizens, greatly reducing risk. Our entire country's infrastructure is modular to prevent total system failures, even within a single city. Considering my country is almost fully under sea level, a storm followed by a flood is the most likely SHTF disaster. This would occur if our specific part of the modular flood protection infrastructure breaks down. Even in that case there is an advanced warning system and additional safety measures to delay flood onset. If I can get my ass to my parents in the meantime, their location most likely won't be affected.Even then, this is so unlikely to happen, I'm not worried about it. Remember Katrina and how much damaged that caused? Katrina is classified as a once-in-a-100-years storm. My area has flood protection that holds for once-in-a-4000-years storm. My parents live in a more 'risky' place, so their flood protection is built for once-in-10000 (!) years storms. On top of that: we don't get hurricanes in my region to begin with, this is meteorologically (close to) impossible. The worst storms we experienced in the past 100+ years barely classify as category 1 storms. So yeah, a 'forced' bug out - even in the worst case situation - will be due local forces. Meaning most likely public transport is available, and else I'll just bike. I've done long distance travel through storms, ice, snow and other extreme weather before. It's really not that big of a deal - especially because we have other family members closer to us (several options between 0-20 km, barely a 1 hour ride) which we could go to as well.|||I'm not even American, but I heard you have senate (?) elections coming up next year? I guess your best bet will be (especially if you're in a red state) to convince 2 people to vote Dem, and convince one of those to convince another person to vote Dem.

The landlord can't tell you they won't rent it to you because your black or a woman for example, as that would open them up for a lawsuit...

I think the absolute key to my wardrobe is to have solid, impeccable, classic peaces to counterbalance the more frivolous vintage shapes. For example: classic french turtleneck sweaters, classic elbow length sleeved boat neck tshirt, a classic pencil skirt, classic button ups, classic blazer. These need to fit absolutely perfectly and need to SCREAM well made. I have all of those in black (and white for the button ups/tshirts), and as time goes on, I add to those classic pieces in other (again, timeless and classic) colours that suit me. I combine those pieces with more vintage-like pieces, always telling myself: only wear *one* vintage aspect not to overdo it (like I said in the previous post). I went through my recent orders at one of the sites I shop, and these would be examples of vintage inspired clothes that do *really* well in a more modern setting when balanced with those classics:https://topvintage.nl/nl/vintage-retro/50s-tiffany-swing-skirt-in-navy-and-white? orhttps://topvintage.nl/nl/vintage-retro/50s-beverly-high-waist-swing-skirt-in-mustard^ Skirt with typical vintage A-line shape, but in solid colour. https://topvintage.nl/nl/vintage-retro/50s-vera-swing-dress-in-black-and-red?^ Dress in typical A-line 50s shape, but with a non-traditional print (This dress is gorgeous with a black blazer for example)https://topvintage.nl/nl/vintage-retro/50s-vedette-swing-dress-in-raspberry-pink?^ Dress with a vintage inspired silhouette, but very much modernized. I just wear this as is. I love the shape of this dress. https://topvintage.nl/nl/vintage-retro/50s-irvine-tartan-swing-skirt-in-red^Traditional red tartan, A-Line skirt. Combine with black turtleneck. This one can especially be nicely spiced it when combined with interesting (non-vintage) jewelry/accessories. Also, I am in a more business like environment, so I need to be conscious with how over the top I am in general. I really can't go out as a vintage doll, so I absolutely need a feeling of it being modern *enough*. I definitely think you could take more prominent vintage elements and still have a perfectly appropriate, interesting outfit without your look being overdone.For example, this outfit:https://topvintage.nl/nl/vintage-retro/40s-estelle-blouse-in-lipstick-redIncluding the cherry pencil skirt is just gorgeous.

If it exists, it sounds like something your study association will organize.Google EBF Groningen and email them, they might be able to tell you if something like this exists. |||Yeah, definitely my case. For me, it's most likely the root cause of being socially introverted (as in: social interaction is exhausting), even though I'm ENTJ. I have major issues processing sensory information, especially sounds. When I'm having a conversation with someone, I'm not only listening to this person, but also to the 3 conversations in earshot, and I just can't tune out. The same with looking for subtle movements in the people around me. Socially, I'm pretty strong, *because* I pick up on all of these things, but it is beyond exhausting for me. Whenever I'm outside, I wear headphones to listen to music, because all the traffic noises are bothering me. Whenever I'm working, I need a closed off office and need to listen to music, and although I don't mind people walking in, I can't deal with an *actual* open door policy, as the open door is too distracting, because I pick up on every shadow and how conversations move past the door.

Even less that are *cheap*. If you want an alternative to the UK/Australia, you can have a look at the University of Groningen, in the Netherlands, where I study. It's one of the few EU mainland university that offers a comprehensive list of English taught programmes at both bachelor and master level. The University of Groningen is not necessarily cheap though, with tuition being about 9-13k euros a year depending on your programme. Living expenses are OK for a western european city.|||I thought I remembered you. Is your daughter still looking at an International Business degree?|||Reading your comments make a few things stick out (you don't make each point explicit, so I might assume a few things): - You come from well connected, influential families. This means you will have a large professional network through your parents and other family members when you grow up.- You come from a wealthy or upper middle class family. Meaning you had access to high quality education (private school even), and most likely could do any extra curricular sports or cultural activity you'd like growing up. This also means there was no stress you were exposed to about money to buy essentials (food, housing, transportation, clothes). Also, you most likely had access to high quality medical care throughout your life.- Your parents are married meaning you come from a stable family unit.All of the above **IS** privilege! You *are* privileged and you know, you should be pretty damn happy that you are. You should also realize that there are many people your age that - from the outside - seem to have nothing wrong with their life, but who deal with tremendous stresses even at a young age: parents being unemployed and hearing them argue daily about money, having a single parent who has to work 60 hours a week meaning you'd have to take care of your younger siblings, having divorced parents who refuse to co parent and having to hear their mom yell and scream at their dad on the phone because dad got a new girlfriend, dealing with mental or (invisible) physical illnesses. I could go on, and on, and on, and on. The point is, these people find themselves in situation which takes their energy away from things like their education. You can't put in the hours needed to do all your home work if you have 2 siblings to take care of. As a results these peers will not get the scholarships you *will* receive based on academic merit, as a result of which they might not get to go to colleges as good as you'll maybe end up at. Your parents providing you with everything you need to succeed so you don't have to worry about anything else than getting good grades and developing yourself to become a responsible adult means you are privileged. Acknowledge that, because by not acknowledging that, you are not acknowledging the fact that others are struggling to achieve the same as you are, even though they have a lot more on their plate. Depending on how much you are not acknowledging this and how vocal you are about it (I can't judge from your posts), your peers will most likely think you are an unappreciative, spoiled brat. And they would be right about thinking so. Now, how to deal with this: 1. Be happy and **appreciative** and acknowledging about how much you have going on for you in your life due to your upbringing and family situation. 2. Be empathetic and understanding towards those who aren't as lucky, and be the kind of person that tries to help others succeed in life as well.Here's a comic on the topic which explains the above in a more visual way: http://thewireless.co.nz/articles/the-pencilsword-on-a-plate|||This is my point though, it seems that 'skinny', healthy weight people (based on my circle of friends and acquantences) look at a plate of food and react with 'wow, that's a lot of food!', while I as an overweight person, or my obese friends, who grew up with other perceptions of portion size, would think the same portion size is totally normal. Somehow, I think internalizing this idea of how large a regular portion is, also influences your feeling of hunger or satiation. If you feel you've had a small portion, your mind might trick you in telling you you should still feel hungry, even if that's physically not the case. That's why I want to retrain those perceptions, and have them more in line with what a healthy weight person with a more realistic perception of food would consider normal portion sizes.|||Also, nobody seems to get that masculinity does not equal alpha male/the red pill insecurity bullshit.

For lips, when mine get really bad, I put on loads before bed. And I mean loads: to the point where my lips are seriously sticky. When I wake up, they'd *still* be sticky because not everything got absorbed. Gentle lip scrub in the shower and my lips would go from painfully chapped to plump and soft overnight. I use lanolin in more ways as well! My daily moisturizer is lanolin based, as is my Vaseline replacement I use at night on top of my moisturizer when my skin is extra dry.|||The concept of losing weight is easy: eat less calories than your body consumes.I wouldn't start out with tracking calories straight away. Take a week or even a few days, and write down everything you eat. Don't just note down 'sandwich', but be specific: two slices of white/brown bread, number of slices of cheese/ham/others, how many spoons of peanut butter, etc etc etc. Maybe for some things, you wouldn't be able to pin point exactly how much of something you ate. For example: one plate of pasta with x,y,z vegatables. That's fine as well. After you did this for a few days, make a rough estimate of how much calories you are eating, using for example MyFitnessPal. Also use the calculators found on this sub to calculate your daily caloric needs. From that moment on, you can evaluate how much you've been eating, how much you should eat to lose weight, and where, based on your current eating pattern, you could most easily scrap calories.Why I recommended first taking some time to track your 'normal' eating patterns, is because it's really good to have some insight into where most of your calories go. Is it snacks, is it huge suppers (because your not aware of what a regular portion of food is like me), or maybe too much soda. If you go straight into tracking, you will start with a lot of enthusiasm, but after a while, enthusiasm will wane a bit, and you might fall back in your current eating traps if you don't know what they are. People on this sub have different ways of reaching a calorific deficit, which goes from eating *a lot* of small snacks throughout the day, to literaly only eating one big meal. If you gain some more insight in your own eating patterns and what type of pattern satisfies you most, it will help you ease into cutting out calories in places where it's most natural for *you* to do so.|||I switched over to desktop because your post hit hard. The path to success for our generation really can't be compared to those of our parents (or grandparents). I'm one of the younger millennials and I've been looking at the older successful millenial women for inspiration and guidance on the steps I need to take to be successful myself. And frankly: it's terrifying. I don't know about the place where you are from, but from my perspective (Western EU woman), there is *a lot* of pressure to be academically successful if you want to get a high paying career. The discussion about young people getting burned out due to 'pressure to achieve' (as we call it in my language) is very much a thing, although the baby boomer generation does not acknowledge us speaking out about it *at all*, saying this kind of pressure has been part of each and every generation. I've seen so many friends suffer from serious burn out symptoms, but they would be afraid to take a semester off because it would reflect bad on them once they apply for a job if they have nothing to show for they study delays.I'm currently finishing up grad school, and I have been *anything* but lazy: multiple MSc degrees, multiple internships/relevant jobs, official certifications, high GPA, volunteering + extracurricular student leadership positions. I have been working 70+ hours a week for the past 5+ years to get the kind of resume that will make me competitive. And the scary part is: I am one of *many* students who have this kind of track record. When I ask the baby boom generation about their experiences entering the job market for highly competitive positions, I have yet to meet *anyone* who had to do *this* much during they studies to even be considered for interviews. Something specific for my age bracket of millenials: we were teenagers when the 2008 crash happened and many of us saw our parents lose jobs and not recover from the crash. I've had this discussion a lot with peers... we demand this kind of work ethic and resume building from ourselves, because we are terrified to find ourselves in the same position. The thinking goes: we might be overqualified, but as long as we are *more* overqualified than most of our age brackets *and* those a bit older than us, maybe we will be spared and still get jobs. That being said: I do very much enjoy working with other ambitious millenials. I feel there is a real hunger for success among us while there still being *a lot* of understanding for the need for our physical and mental well being and the importance of personal life outside of work. There are also so many women among this group. I really hope this will be the first generation that gets to build strong connections between ambitious women who will support each other through an 'old girls network' kinda away as they rise. |||That's the thing. By Dutch law, the universities *can't* decline any NL or EU student that applies and meets the entry requirements. Even if the university would suddenly have 10k of additional and unexpected applications that meet requirements, they would have to accept every single one of them. It's part of the equal access to education ideology of this country. Combine that law with the comment I made elsewhere in this thread (uni's can't own or manage housing real estate by law), and you have a housing problem like we are facing today, which the university is awfully powerless to do something about.|||About 50 hours a week on average (with week yo week variation of course).

Not sure if I could have managed without. |||I'm now doing a FEB Masters that's considered more 'difficult'... Yeah, not really. The reason why econ students think econ is difficult is because of the slightly more complicated maths that are involved.. Meaning, if you have STEM background (and had to pass actual mathematics courses, like a CS/AI student would have), it's still easy. Even econometrics.. there are *so* many maths/physics students who just get their econometrics degree on the side for shits and giggles, because they're bored and have some spare time left. Like I said: educational quality definitely is high, and it's organized way better than programmes at science and engineering. At FSE, the lecturers are definitely 'the crazy professor' type who love their field, who love their subjects, and are a bit wacky when teaching what they love. At FEB, the teachers are much more focused on didactics and actually organize a single course unit to fit the bigger curriculum as best as they can, with a lot of focus on general academic skills that carry over between courses, while at FSE this is more or less lacking all together. I'm just saying, if you come from a STEM background and are used to the FSE work load and have a proper talent for mathematics, a degree at FEB will most likely not be a challenge at all.|||I'm guessing that won't be doing her any good.. most likely this woman was raised by her mother in a similar fashion and was never taught (or even shown) basic life skills.|||I think agendas are conscious (although may be not necessarily as 'An agenda' but in more loose terms), but not all actions are.If an ENTJ has an agenda regarding.. idk... 'wanting a promotion', they might find themselves small talking to people who might possible be in positions of power with regard to that promotion. But that *just* happens. It's not like an ENTJ will be like 'well, let's talk to John on the off chance he might be on the appointment committee for position X'.. It's more intuitive in which an ENTJ (subconsciously?) puts him or herself in a position to fulfil that agenda. That's why I said: *everything* we do has a purpose, even if it's not a conscious decision to do that certain thing. This is in my opinion the core of the ENTJs superpower regarding getting things done (and why some types are so intimidated by ENTJ types).|||.... just because I'm honestly really, really curious about your thought process: what made you think this might be the case in OPs  life? To me (and I think others based on the downvotes) your comment is extremely random.|||Wow. Wait. Back up. Any chance he actually did ask your permission with that question you didn't hear very well? I mean, if he actually asked you whether he could touch you, and you answered 'of course. Yes!'.. I mean, from his perspective he got a very clear consent message from you. He seemed to ask your direct permission for your bra and boobs as well in the form of a direct question from what you wrote. You feeling uncomfortable is not acceptable in any way, but in this situation, I'm not sure what you expect from him. He's not a mind reader and from what you wrote, he did *his* due diligence to ask you for consent, and you didn't at any point say 'stop, I'm not comfortable' or something similar.Just like he should ask for your consent, you also need to use *your* voice to express consent and also withdrawal of any previously given consent. Any consent given, can at any point be withdrawn, please remember this! You can tell him you want to have sex, get naked and on top of him, and decide at that very moment you changed your mind. Any good guy will understand and respect such a decision. But if you've been saying along the way you wanted to have sex and acted in such a way that implied consent, you can't expect him to simply *know* by somehow reading your mind that suddenly your consent is no longer there. You need to tell him.Consent is a difficult topic but it *is* a two way street with both parties having a responsibility towards making sure consent is communicated. Consent can be as big and as small as you want and need it to be, from 'i want to have sex with you' to 'i don't want you to touch my tiny toe'. Although you might expect your SO to ask about the first, you probably wouldn't expect your SO to explicitly ask about the second. There is a lot of subtality, which only you can express. For example, there are certain very specific ways I do not like my nipples to be touched. I had to sit down my boyfriend and very explicitly tell him and show him what I do and do not want and allow when it comes to my nipples. Sure it was awkward, but if I didn't tell him, I couldn't expect him to know and act upon my wishes. There have also been countless times when we would be having sex, and he would do something that I normally consent to, but didn't want at that specific moment. The only to have him know is by telling him 'no, please don't do that tonight'.Don't you **ever** tell yourself 'I will look like a priss if I comment about it now' or stay quiet in any other way. You and your feelings matter! You have the right to change your mind! You should not feel sexually uncomfortable in any way or at any time!If your guy is decent, he *will* listen. If he won't listen, he is not a decent guy and you should not be involved with him to begin with. |||Your dad is just an ass, regardless of whether he's an ENTJ or not.How to deal with it?

In my country, the use of *any* weapon by police is strictly defined by law. Only under a very specific set of circumstances is a police offer allowed to use force.

If not, consequences follow.|||/u/sarahmichelef is top comment for a reason. Her question 'what do you want the system to help you accomplish?' is definitely the key question you need to be answering to yourself. Everyone uses their bujo for different reasons: some use it to keep themselves in check, some use it to help them with their mental situations (ADHD for example), some people are naturally chaotic and use bujo for structure. All of these *sound* very similar reasons, but they really are not. For me: I am already a very disciplined and structured person naturally, my bujo helps me to optimize my productivity beyond what I normally achieve. Right now, I'm facing some emotional tough times, and I need some time off to focus on me instead of everything else. I stopped using my bullet journal all together for now to focus on my emotional and mental health instead.

The use of public funding for private investments require heavy ministry oversight. If you're interested in the exact criteria of when this is allowed, have a look at the ministry letter HO/CBV/05/22162 (google it!). Tl;dr: housing doesn't qualify. You need to provide a source if you want to make this claim, because the university meets with the municipality and housing offices multiple times throughout the year to discuss exactly this issue. They are communicating. That being said, the universities *can't* in many cases even provide a perfect forecast. You should understand that students do not apply directly to the university, they apply through studielink. Studielink is independent from the universities, and the universities have minimal access to the studielink database (privacy). As a result, the university does get *some* rough insight into enrollment data *from* studielink based on their own inhouse analyses, but the uni's can't verify that data. The only time when the university has definitive insight into the numbers is when students go through the full admission process, have paid their tuition and received their student number. *That's* when they fully enter the university system and when the university can start making their own, proper forecasts. Obviously, this is way to late in terms of still wanting to act on that data. Ask any planner or scheduler of this university the question: 'when can you give me a *reliable* forecast for the september enrollments?' and each of them will answer you: 'in october.'|||You know what, I think I'd actually like that. |||Yeah, this is me. With me it's just a skeletal issue, even after surgical correction, I can't breath through my nose very well. When I'm just resting, I can breath through my nose just fine (after surgery), but I simply *can't* physically get enough air in through my nose when I'm walking or exercising. It happens. Protip: if you have this, be weary of sinus infections and the like..

Obviously you're now at a serious (forceful) deficit, so getting yourself to get used to a maintenance diet will take you some more effort than it would someone who lost their weight more slowly at less big CICO deficits. I'm sure you'll manage though! Great job, kick some more ass the coming months. We'll be waiting for the next set of progress pics.|||Yeah, that's going to be tough. I'll be honest with you, the flights between Belfast/Dublin and Amsterdam are dirt cheap. I would start sending out applications while still in Ireland and grab a flight to attend your interview once you get one. If that's financially difficult for you, it will definitely also be difficult for your to bridge the gap financially if you still needs a couple of months to even get a job once you get here. Also, do note that all these nice EU rights will go away as soon as the UK leaves the Union. If you have any right to Irish citizenship (as in, the Republic) through ancestry, that's maybe something you also want to consider.|||Like the other user said: it's through a contract with a private party. The UC Groningen has the same setup. Part of your acceptance to the UC is signing a nandatory contract with that private party. However, the number of students at UCs is very limited (a few hundred max per year), which makes such a setup doable. Also, most UCs only make it mandatory to live in their UC specific housing foe their first year. Some don't even provide housing for later years at all.|||I am Dutch.

Those sound like some great goals in that case. I wish you all the best for 2018!|||One thing to consider:That doesn't mean they have an equal and a fair chance at actually getting these scholarships. There are many Jane vs. John studies that show that women are less likely to be selected for jobs, funding, etc. because the traits we (subconsciously) use to select 'winners' are traits we don't typically (subconsciously) assign to women, because we (subconsciously) see them as masculine traits. For example, if you have a scholarship that asks for community leadership, a man will leave a bigger positive impact, because the concept of 'leadership' is something we consider (subconsciously) to be masculine. While if you replace the exact same letter/resume/whatever with a female name, the image (subconsciously) left behind is that of a 'bossy' woman, not necessarily that of leader, and thus less qualified for this scholarship.This effect compounds, because people who won awards in the past, are more likely to win them in the future. The purpose of women scholarships is to counteract this effect. The 'true' discriminatory issue is not that of affirmative action, but much more the subconscious nature of societal gender (and also for example racial) inequality. This affects all of us, whether we like it or not. Even among women, these societal norms cause women to judge fellow women differently from men. It's the same reason why I as a white woman - even though I do truly not consider myself racist - still somehow tense up more when I come across a black man alone at night compared to a white man. That kind of behaviour *is* discriminatory, but not *consciously* racist and purely a result of long term social programming. Affirmative action ensures minority groups improve their representation in society, thereby altering these subconscious discriminatory social norms in the long term. |||I agree with \\\\u\\\\yandr001.

As as rather short woman, I would feel far more intimidated by a (very) overweight tall guy that would make these kinds of harassing remarks that border on threats to physically harm we ('I'll wait for you outside the store when the shift finishes up' God knows what he could do) than I would if someone of a normal posture would do so. Same why I would feel more threatend by a big, muscle-y, bulky guy making these comments opposed to one with a normal posture. I've been assaulted by a fat man before, and frankly: you can't do anything as a small woman when he puts his weight behind him. You can't push him away obviously, and you can't reach his face or balls to kick him for example to get him off you (I tried), which you could do with someone of a more normal posture (or even a bulky dude).|||Especially in the case of larger companies; ask to see their diversity policy. Diversity is a lot more than a gender problem. A good diversity policy is focused on equality throughout, be it on basis of gender, race, sexuality, or disability. A company that can honestly say they value diversity in the broadest sense (which is *hard*) and work towards equality even if progress is slow, that's a company I would like to work for.Why? Because I believe awareness and willingness are more important than the status quo at the company.

I grew up with daily home cooked meals, and still cook every day, so maybe my view is distorted, but I really don't get how someone could *not* cook. I mean, 99% of my meals are: cut up veggies, cut up chicken, warm up some oil in a pan, put chicken in pan, stir till brown, add veggies to pan, stir till warm.  Cooking pasta/rice/potatoes is literally putting some water in a pot, boiling it, add stuff, wait for 10 minutes, empty contents in strainer. Sure, cooking steaks, making sauces from scratch, and baking anything more complex than bread.. those definitely require some skill and mostly a lot of experience.. But cooking a basic meal really doesn't seem that complicated to me?Again, I'm asking this honestly without judgement, but I just don't understand which of these steps would require any kind of skill any adult doesn't have. |||Definitely patch test it though, when trying it for the first time!

Also, here, it's not only the discharge of a weapon that counts as using force, it's pulling your weapon out of its holster that warrants investigation. I pulled up the law, and there are exactly four situations in which police are allowed to use their firearm:1. To arrest someone of whom it's reasonable to assume they have a weapon *ready to be used at any moment*. (And in a country with low gun possession rates, this means either suspects threatens to use a gun, or you have to actually *see* the gun.)2. During the arrest of someone who has committed or who can be reasonable assume to have committed certain types of serious felonies.3. To control dangerous disorderly situations but only on explicit authority and command of a high ranking officer.4. To stop military mutiny on explicit order of the ministry of defense. And points 1 and 2 carry the additional clause that if the identity of the suspect is known and based on their identity is can be concluded that using non-potentially-lethal force will not result in an unsafe situation even if the arrest might take longer to execute, police is *not* allowed to use firearms. And these are just regular firearms, the use of automatic rifles and snipers by police are even more heavily regulated.Note that 'I fear for my life' is not a valid reason for police to even draw a firearm, unless suspect actually threatens to use lethal force or you actually see them grab a gun.This also puts to burden of proof on the police. If the suspect didn't turn out to have a gun, it's up to the police department to make a case for why the officer 'had reasonable grounds to assume they had a weapon'. Which is pretty damn hard to do conclusively. |||Ha.

For obvious reasons, there is not a lot of 'regular' surfing going on in the Netherlands. They're called SurfAce. I don't know anyone there, but I'm sure if you just email them and ask them if you can join on one or two occasions to see if you like the association, they'll be happy to include you (like most associations do). Becoming a member of an association is definitely a good way to make some friends.https://www.gswv-surface.nl/nl/||| Because I'm an idiot who really has no interest in car mechanics: I learned how to drive a manual car, so I know how to use the clutch. What exactly does the driver do wrong for the clutch to burn out? Using only the clutch to actually drive instead of 'switching over' to the gas pedal?|||Your posts made me think of a conversation I had with my INTP SO yesterday. A year or two ago, my SO was caught in an extremely emotionally dire situation in which some very tough decisions had to be made on a very short time scale. It was a turning point in his life, which - even though the situation was shit at that moment - ended up being a catalyst for amazing personal progress in the last one or two years. He just had to hit rock bottom face first for that to happen.My SO set me down yesterday, because he wanted to discuss that time again now that it's in his past. And he explained how he was grateful for what I did for him back then. I helped him get clarity about the situation he found himself in, by categorizing options and their pros and cons. I stated my preferred course of actions, but I *made him make his own choice*. I kept him moving throughout the ordeal by taking care of every and all practicality, but he had to point directions. He told me yesterday that back in that moment, he wanted nothing more than for me to just make the decisions for him, because that would be easy and safe and secure. But I didn't, and instead I made sure he had the clarity of mind to make his own choices, which gave him - at least in retrospect - a sense of ownership and power over his life. It made him pick himself up from the ground and made him want to turn the situation around.I seriously cried in his arms like a little child when he told me this. It was a really tough and uncertain time for me as well, trying to be strong but not being sure whether I was doing the right thing. Usually I'm so certain about my course of action, but those couple days I was anything but regarding what I should do and how to proceed. I am so proud of my guy and everything he has fought and worked for since, although he went through hell, he came out alive and stronger because of what *he* did. It was all him and his effort. My INTP is one hell of a man.|||Why are you 'testing' people? If *you* are looking for a friend, why should *they* proof themselves to *you*?Maybe you should try turning your attitude around for a while, and start out with trying to show how amazing you are as a friend first, and once that attracts people, you can pick which ones you really want to invest in due time. It's not just about you.. as much as you are testing them, those people are also simultaneously evaluating your compatibility as a friend..  and this behaviour fails that evaluations dramatically. Both parties need to see value in a friendship, not just you.|||Yes! This is something I have been thinking about as well. What's the 'etc.'? I'd be very interested in getting the full list of stuff you carry for your kitty. What kind of carrier do you use? I was actually thinking of getting either a backpack carrier or cross-shoulder carrier. The bulky plastic carriers with the small handles are really tough to carry around for larger distances on bike/public transport/foot (although for a car ride, I guess it will be fine, but I don't have a car). |||Ah shit, I forgot about that rule. The only thing that might be a loophole is this (no clue if it works though): • nadat u 18 jaar bent geworden op enig moment ten minste10 jaar buiten Nederland, Aruba, Curaçao, Sint Maarten of deEuropese Unie woont; en• tijdens die 10 jaar ook een andere nationaliteit heeftWhen the law went into effect, does the 10 year counter start from the first of April 2003 or does it work retroactively? If it *doesn't* work retroactively and OP is born in 1996, that would mean that OP might have just turned 18 by the time the 10 years are up for her dad, meaning she was a Dutch citizen while being a legal adult, and wouldn't have lost their citizenship when their dad lost theirs.|||Oof.. This reads like me about 8 years ago.. Here's my piece of insight: 'being mature', 'being/becoming an adult', 'being a grown up' are all personal to *you*. You set your *OWN* goals, ambitions, and plans. You succeeding is judged by no other parameter than what you consider a success. What your parents, family, friends, and society think you are and should be does not matter. Being successful in not a battle against their standards, it's a battle against your own. So, stop acting, stop pretending and start living your own life with your own goals. And if you don't know what those are. That's fine, in reality, nobody *truly* does.. that's why we tend to cling on the the idea of what our people and our society says we should do. Just... take it day by day, and try every day to do best by you, not them. |||Same. Yes I worry more about my weight than the average person, because the average person doesn't give a flying fuck.

The RUG is pretty well known within the academic community for that scientific field, and the programme is pretty good.You should definitely try to get a PhD once you're here! They are paid positions (and you don't need to find your own funding *at all* like in the UK), and both the science faculty and the medical faculty are in quite good financial positions, with quite a large number of recent funds and open positions. You guys definitely sound like fun! If you ever wanna meet up and hang out, let me know. It's always difficulty to make some new friends once you get a bit older, so definitely interested in getting to know interesting people like yourselves.|||In the main child free sub, you see a lot of these flaired under 'rants'. I do belief there is a need for a space in which you can rant or vent among like-minded people, but more from the perspective of work place annoyances, unequal treatment, or simply annoyances in interpersonal relations which arises from being childfree. |||In my country (Netherlands) it actually is a full time job, not a study course. PhD's are employees of the university, receive a salary and all rights and benefits associated with being an employee. A full time contract at Dutch universities equals 38 hours / week. I think there are very few PhD's who have an average below 50 hours / week, and at he most prestigious labs, 60-80 hours aren't unheard of either. Then again, all of the academic staff (tenured or not) probably make even more extreme hours.|||Because I see that famous Reddit post all the time of dem vs rep voting records on the type of topics Reddit seems to care about.

The PMP certificates are regulated by a world wide organization for project managers, and that certificate is pretty well known in the field. It will still cost you some money and time, but not the amounts required for a full masters degree.The PMP requires a minimum amount of PM experience. They also have an 'entry level' certificate that doesn't have the experience requirement and is meant for juniors who want to get established in the PM field. Less well known and obviously less valuable, but that would also be an option. I plan on taking that one while I'm working on my thesis and finishing up my masters degree. It's only a couple of hundred bucks as well. |||I love it when people share their 'ugly', 'nonspecial' bujo's. Just a notebook as a productivity tool and nothing else.

Working with children, young adults, women, minorities, refugees, etc etc? If I imagine myself in your situation, I would probably develop some kind of education program that targets people with an interest in starting a company in one of those specific social groups. Depending on your social group, you can link up with organizations that have physical space and equipment you could use and fit your demographic, and run your program as a volunteer either for free or for a small participation fee. It would probably tick all the boxes with regard to your entrepreneurial needs to create, build, and interact, without actually having to start a company with all stress involved. |||I also was unsure about the ENTJ vs. INTJ thing when trying to figure out my own type. When I figured it out, it was actually really easy to see how I am definitely an ENTJ and not INTJ. You only have to ask yourself one question: what triggers your actions, thinking, planning and scheming?For me, I realized that I am *always* triggered by external systems/situations. I can be part of an organization and *notice* an inefficiency, or *see* an undiscovered synergy between departments or processes, or *feel* (gasp!) problems in teamwork and work culture.  All of these externally driven inputs drive me to *envision* a new strategy/way of doing/solution to a problem/etc, but at all times, my best ideas and best work is always triggered from the outside.This is Te-Ni in action, which is ENTJ thinking. An INTJ has Ni-Te thinking, which is *exactly the other way around*! An INTJ would have spend their life building an (internal) vision of how the external world should be, and in shaping their external world, will always fall back on how their ideal system *should be* (Ni) and reason from that perspective how to change the external system (Te). The ENTJ reasons from *how it is* right here and now (Te), and reasons from that perspective how things could be better (Ni).|||My dad is great, but definitely not a 'fantastic' father. He made plenty of mistakes and could have done a lot of things better than he did. In the end, he's just a man who tried raising his daughter to the best of his ability and he definitely did a good job. Just saying this, because it's important for you as well to know you don't need to be the perfect man, husband, or father to do a good job at raising your little girl and have her become a strong woman one day.||| &gt; I just get a bad gut feeling whenever I hear someone talk about things like \\\"knowing what their body needs\\\".Although HAES typically used that phrase to justify eating all crap they want because their body tells them it's yummy so it must be good, there is truth in this statement imho. I don't count calories (anymore), and instead just try to listen to what my body is telling me. Is this hunger or am I bored? Is this a craving (and if so, what kind of craving)? Or a combination of both? Especially the last category is interesting, because I've learned to make a distinction of different types of hunger. At times, I'm hungry while I crave carbs, while at others I want protein, etc. When I eat protein when I'm actually craving carbs, I will end up over eating, because my food isn't satisfying me, and the cravings are still there. This was all part of really getting back in touch with my body and understanding what nutrition does to my body. |||I mean, men and women *aren't* the same, but do deserve equal rights. I'm a female in engineering, and the thing is, the way men sometimes behave among themselves can be feel very threatening to a woman. The way men talk to one another about 'how they want to do other women' for example... if you're the only woman there and you have this club of big, burly men, twice your height and size, who in theory could do anything they'd want to you right on the spot.. yeah, not nice to hear from them how they wouldn't mind to run into Christina from HR after closing to have a go at her. I hope you can imagine this situation to be quite unsettling and uncomfortable from a women's perspective.If the same guy stops by your office trying to get an uncomfortable hug out of you, or asks you whether your blouse is new while obviously staring at your boobs.... yeah. That's not cool.Frankly, I don't want to be treated *as a man*, because I am NOT a man, I simply want to be able to work in an environment where I'm not feeling threatened, just like the men don't feel threatened at their workplace.|||It's doable. I've done a double degree in my bachelor's as well, and yes, scheduling is a pain in the ass, but otherwise, the work load is fine if you're a quick study and disciplined to actually do your work instead of getting stressed once an exam rolls around. My personal experience is: if you actually have to study from dawn to dusk before your exam, something went wrong way, way earlier. Exam weeks are usually some of the most relaxed time throughout the year for me, during which I usually spend my time sleeping, gaming, and working out to just be as relaxed as possible, while slowly making my way through my notes and summaries one last time.My whole circle of friends is full of people doing multiple degrees. It's uncommon, but definitely not strange or unheard of.I had a job, did multiple committees and drank loads of beer on the side as well. At OP: Don't be too scared about the work load. Just do it and see how far you get, and know that the first semester is the toughest, after that, things will become easier. The question 'why would you even do multiple degrees?' has  one very simple answer: because you can.|||So, I do keep a regular google calendar for stuff like class schedules, meetings and keeping track of birthdays etc. If I note a static event in my bullet journal, it's because action is required (read meeting documents, read chapter 4, etc). I have a monthly spread, with at the end a tiny section for 'stuff that comes up and needs to be included next month'. Anything that needs more than a month of lead up time gets a dedicated page: for example, the semester long deadlines overview I mentioned. When I make a new monthly spread at the beginning of the month, I review all the long term spreads again.Other than that, I take a double page spread. On the left side, I have a running to do list of stuff I would like to do that week. On the right side, I divide the page into monday through friday. I note any events from my monthly spread to the corresponding day, and slowly I start migrating stuff from my weekly list to specific days. Never more than max 4-5 to do's per day (but often only 2 or 3)! That's my focus and priority, and I always try to make sure I finish the to dos for that day. If I don't it gets migrated to the next day, and I make sure to that thing first thing in the morning. If I have time left over in the day, I have a look at my weekly list to see if there is stuff I can work on. In the weekend, I try to finish up the remaining to do's for that week... and any points I don't get to finish, I very carefully consider whether I should move them to next week, or whether to strike them all together. It's also a good way for me to track whether I'm not overburdening myself. If I find day in day out I can't get my to do's done, it's a sign I need to drop certain activities because I'm having too much on my plate.I don't do habit trackers, mood trackers, spending trackers, or any of that stuff that only clutters up my journal and distracts me from my productivity. If a habit is *truly* that important to you, it can take up one of those 4-5 today's priority to do spots. I don't do pictures, or drawings, washi, highlighters or different colours. Just a single dotted notebook and a single black pen. |||So, you're a teen. Like you've probably noticed: growing up is an emotional mess while your mind is slowly forming into adult you. That's also the thing, you might not be able yet to fully settle on all functions, because you are not yet at mental maturity level in which your lower functions actually settle and start showing. If you want to focus on functions, try figuring out what your dominant function is, and what *might* be your second function. Functions have everything to do with how you think and how you process information, not necessarily your hobby's or your talents. First off, try figuring out whether your dominant function is introverted or extraverted driven. Personally, I think this is easier than actually figuring out the letter itself. I for example, have Te as a dominant function. I notice that my mind 'clicks' and starts working after some random comment from a random person that suddenly makes my mind go: holy shit, if you connect this this and this in such a way, that and that will happen, how haven't I realized this before?! My light bulb moments that drive my thinking are externally sourced. Also remember, like in my case: even though my dominant function is extraverted, I - as a person - am not. I am an incredibly introverted person: people exhaust me immensely, I need multiple hours of sensation free/people free time a day, and I enjoy individual activities very much. These two things *can* coexist and it doesn't make me any less of an ENTJ.So ask yourself: are you very driven from internal frameworks (regardless whether that's knowledge, emotional, or intuition) or is your mind more focused on reacting on this you see, hear, experience outside in the world itself?After figuring out whether it's an e or i, you can start analyzing whether your external processing (in the case of e) is passed through a T, N, S or F filter, or whether your internal framework (in the case of i) is build on a T, N, S or F perspective.|||I actually own a bunch of vintage silk scarves which I don't take full advantage of.

Well, this way you can have your cake and eat it too.|||Look, if you see a journal or pen in a picture posted to this sub, I think it's perfectly fine and reasonable to ask about the item and have a discussion about it in the comment section. That would really just be a natural part of the conversations going on in this sub. However, I do think that's distinctly different from having dedicated discussion posts on topics such as 'what would be the best ink to use for my Stalogy/Kokuyo/Rhodia notebook?'. Discussions on on pens/ink/notebooks are probably better suited for other subreddits. Quite a few are already mentioned in the sidebar. I'm reasonably active on r/notebooks for example and that sub is definitely a better fit for discussing notebook options and how the paper works with fountain pens.The exceptions I can think of are *maybe*: 'my life requires me to take my bujo with me outside, even in harsher weather (rain or snow), any recommendations for notebooks or pens?' But even this is tangental (as it's not specific to bullet journaling and only relates to the topic of productive bullet journaling by association) and would also be a perfectly good question for a sub like r/notebooks.I would be interested to hear the opinions of other users on this topic though, so feel free to discuss this! |||Had a look at your site.

Ik ben zelf lid bij Cleopatra (laat maar weten als je langs wil komen tijdens KEI, no probs om af te spreken als je dat wat lijkt), maar uiteindelijk mijn plek voornamelijk bij mijn studievereniging gevonden. Mijn punt is meer: schrijf niks van tevoren af. Ga juist dat ervaren waarvan je eigenlijk op voorhand denkt: .... *I'm not so sure*. Ga vooral langs bij Vindicat tijdens de KEI, *juist* omdat je denkt dat het minder je ding is. Ik kan me nog herinneren dat ik een keer totaal straalbezopen midden in de nacht thuis kwam en mijn pa m'n kamer binnen kwam de volgende dag rond het middaguur om te kijken of ik nog leefde. Volgens mij kwam er alleen maar wat zielig gebrabbel uit, want mijn vader zat zich helemaal dood te lachen om mijn toestand. Half uur later kwam hij weer binnen met een groot glas water, een beker yoghurt en een gebakken ei met spek. Dat is wat ik bedoel met thuiswonen kan ook een vangnet zijn om nóg meer uit je studententijd te halen dan anderen doen.. al heb ik dusdanig bezopen thuis komen wel érg snel afgeleerd daarna.Studios gaan weg voor ~20 punten, rond de 1.5 a 2 jaar.

Besides that: YOU NEED HOBBIES. Something you enjoy, that ticks the boxes it needs to tick in terms of personal importance and makes you learn new stuff, but is NOT work related (though the skills you'd learn might be valuable regardless). Don't just do it through self-study either: follow classes, meet new people.|||I always find it interesting when people type themselves as an ABCx. I mean, we all seem to understand that the online tests are only a starting point and to truly settle on type some solid introspection is needed, but how can the judging vs perception function be undecided if you have already settled on the others? You said you already looked into functions, so you must have noticed that the for ABCx the direction (intraverted/extraverted) are essentially mirrored. An ABCP vs ABCJ are really, *really* different personalities. If you compare this to xBCD or AxCD being undecided, you'll notice that these two align much more which each other on a functional level, as these have the same functions, but in different orders. I don't know, it makes sense me to you're not sure about the order, but to not have settled on *any* function (as is the case with ABCx) just seems weird to me.|||My parents sadly didn't have the ability to offer me any financial support, so I also had to work throughout my studies. I've done about 10 hours/week paid work on average  over the past years. I've been doing TA jobs since really early on in my studies (thanks to my track record and extra curriculars), which pay really well and are somewhat flexible. It's only become easier lately, as I'm one of the most experienced TAs of my department, meaning the profs started coming to me with jobs instead of the other way around (giving me a solid position to negotiate).|||I'm in a long term relationship with my INTP SO who I plan to marry and stay with the rest of my life. I think the most important thing are our shared values regarding the fundamentals: religion, finances, children, general plans for life. Regardless of those shared values, it's hard (let me repeat: HARD) work to maintain a strong, solid relationship. We have a saying: in a relationship, both give 60% and only take 40. That way, there is always more than needed for each of us, and the remaining excess goes towards the value we gain from being a *couple*. We've been through a lot of shit together. Mental illness, long term physical illness, familial problems, etc on both sides. There were times there was only room for one of us in the relationship, because the other needed all the care. We are lucky to have a strong social network of friends and family to lean on in those times, giving the caregiver a break. These situations were tough, but they also show why it's so valuable to have another at your side willing to give it all: when you're in need of care, you'll have a unrequited, close to unlimited source of it. All of this ensures that I can recover asap if disaster strikes.Also, with my SO I can be truly me. He loves me.. he loves *all* of me. I don't wear masks, or act in certain personas when I'm with him (which I easily would do when socializing at work for example). With him, when I hear a song I like, I can suddenly jump up to my feet, look at him, start 'dancing' while showing off the most ridiculous movements just because I feel like it, and he won't think I'm weird or ugly. No, he would get up and starting dancing *with* me. I feel comfortable showing any of my (many) ugly sides of my personality, and I also feel comfortable expressing and discussion intense emotion. All of this makes me grow as a person and makes me feel secure about myself. My SO is also extremely in touch with *my* emotions... somehow. He knows how and *when* to make me laugh, he knows when I need time alone, he knows when I need a hug. He often knows before I know. All of this makes me - quite simply - very happy in life.Some time ago, my SO said something really profound about our relationship. I am someone who lives in the future, while he lives in the here and now. I have a tendency to only look ahead, strive for more, and trying to get there faster, without focusing on myself and my health in the present. He has the tendency to be so focused on the now, he often is not able to look ahead and see why it's all worth it.The thing that my SO said that really struck a cord with me was this: I am the lifeline that grounds you in the present so you don't fly away and have the sun burn your feathers like Icarus making you crash and burn, while your ambitions and plans for our future enable me to actually dream.Anyway, could I manage alone? Yes. Would is be *easier*? Oh, definitely yes. Would my life be better for it? No. |||I've put in a reddit request!

For example, in my city, there's a second hand shop that only sells second hand clothes which are in pristine condition. The shop is very clean, and definitely doesn't feel like a rundown goodwill shop. They select every item that comes in by hand, and all proceeds go to a specific charity. The typical clientele that comes there, mostly is looking for nice but cheap clothing (say below 15 bucks a piece). They have a small area in the back of the shop where they keep all their higher end stuff, that sell for higher prices, which clearly doesn't interest the general public shopping there. However, the higher end stuff is amazing. The women who bring in this stuff (they get a percentage of the sale) are clearly very fashionable, and the style of clothes they sell often matches my own. I've been able to find some amazing Hugo Boss, Armani, Moschino etc pieces for maybe 10-20% of their original sale price.I guess this doesn't necessarily count as a tip for a specific brand/boutique, but finding out whether you have a similar hidden gem close to you is definitely worth your time! I found one that obviously matches my personal style as well, which makes it a fashion gold mine for me.|||I think I'd fit that bill. My parents definitely aren't unintelligent,  but life just got in their way of achieving  all they probably could. I was lucky to be born with quite same innate intelligence, and what my parents did for me was teaching me the value of hard work. They never gave a shit if I was top of the class, because if meant nothing if I didn't work hard for it. They would be much more proud of me if I was failing at whatever and succeeded in the end with minimal results, compared to my academic achievements. Hard work taught me discipline and gave me a damn good ability to plan my work. This is something that has paid off tremendously as I just finished 2 bachelor degrees and am now working on 3 master degrees, next to having a 20 hours a week job that will kick start my career. Yes, I am of above average intelligence, and without that, I definitely wouldn't be able to this, however, I also work damn hard to achieve all of this. Being able to coast due to innate intelligence is really nice, especially if you're intelligent enough to coast through university as well and don't necessarily have a lot of ambition in life (which is fine), but the feeling of pushing yourself to end of your ability, and achieving things you and everyone around you considered impossible.... yeah, that feeling is too impossibly good to describe.|||I mean..

I'm in a long term relationship with the man I intend to marry. I've always told him up front I first wanted to finish my studies and have both of us take to first steps into our careers before getting married. That would give us time to see us through some major life changes and get us in the position where I would be 100% *comfortable* to start a marriage, even though I'm already 100% certain I *want* to marry him (and have been for years).There's an additional layer to this for me: I met my guy at 18 and I have been incredible forthcoming and honest about the life I want to pursue from the start (which included my career being a priority over his and him having to leave behind a lot at one point in his life to accommodate me). He always said he'd support me in this, but considering the timeframe and our ages, I needed to see this promise in action. I'm now at the point in my life where I'm about to commit to the career I told him I wanted all those years ago and we are starting to prepare for this move together. It's going really well, and now push is coming to shove, he keeps telling me: 'I promised to support you all those years ago and I have had a long time to mentally prepare for this step, we're going to do this and I'm not backing out'.Obivously, I'm over the moon with how everything is going between us. I've been incredibly happy with this relationship from the very start, and I realize I love him more and more with every passing year. If he doesn't beat me to it, I plan to propose to him myself once we're settled. |||Still wonder whether it's retroactively... It doesn't say *anywhere*.

I love the little dude, as long as I can give him back to mum after a few hours and don't have to see him again for a few weeks. However, one thing I am seriously impressed about is his restraint around animals. He will only touch an animal when an adult explicitly invites him to do so, even if a dog comes up directly to him all waggling and happy to have some attention. He will just quietly sit or stand still, looking around for an adult to tell him he can pat the animal. Kid is chill. Don't know how they even taught him this, but I'm really happy he's as chill and not annoying as he is. The kid being chill makes having a relationship with my dad a lot easier.|||I'm assuming you're looking for hydrogen peroxide with just a couple of percent of concentration for cleaning purposes right? Stronger is likely to be regulated... Although I guess you could always try to befriend some chemists... Any beauty shop should sell it: DA, Kruitvat, Trekpleister, Etos, etc... maybe even shops like HEMA sell it. For cheap (regular) cleaning supplies you can always check out the discounters like OP=OP or Action, although they usually don't have the fancier stuff like hydrogen peroxide. Anyway, it's called waterstofperoxide in Dutch. Just ask any of the staff at a beauty shop to show you where to find it.|||There is no chance to get a home/house/apartment as a student to be honest... either it's socialized housing, which requires staying on a waiting list for *years*, and any non socialized housing owners usually don't rent to students at all and usually require proof of salary that's 3 or 4 times the rent on top.|||They can't. By Dutch law, universities are not allowed to manage housing real estate. None of the Dutch universities have dormitories. |||Seriously, throughout the whole discussion I'm reading OPs comments, and all I keep thinking (as a young woman): I truly hope this guy isn't raising daughters with this mindset. I was waiting to come across this comment (which took some loooong scrolling down).This man has some serious sexist ideas about women, life, and relationships.|||If my (insider) information is up to date, RUG will also start using a numerus fixus selection procedure starting with the 2019 classes. If you want to be sure, you should email the degree programme people to verify. Selection would likely be similar to the Radboud procedures.. that being said, it's not like doing a GRE or something similar serious. Maybe some maths test (did you do SO calculus? In that case you should be fine) and writing a letter of motivation that should essentially tell the people from admittance that you're not a complete idiot and you've actually properly considered your study choices and made a careful decision to go for AI. Don't stress it too much. If anything, what you usually see is that these fixed number of spots are in place to ensure educational quality, so for a degree program that admits maybe 100 to 200 people, you might find that 200 to 300 apply. Obviously, this is an issue for teaching capacity if you can't serve all those students, but it isn't for applicants as you still have a very, *VERY* BIG chance to get in. Don't treat it like getting into an Ivy with 5 percent admission rate..  just treat it like 'we want to cut out the weakest students who are likely to drop out anyway because we simply don't have the space'.|||How about you also pursue a masters degree in the EU together with her? Most masters are 1 year degree programmes, which would give you a nice amount of time to live together and find out if you are indeed a good fit for a long term relationship. Other than that, if you do end up together long term, you having a masters will make you *much* more employable in the EU in general, as it's quite the norm to have both a BA and MA (in case the two of you decide to live in the EU permanently). You could strategically pick a country that has low tuition fees that fit both of your needs.|||Good service is worth paying for. I *only* buy online if the webshop is doing a good job in offering their online service. There is one webshop I love and understands that they are indeed in a service industry. The women who run this shop measure every single item they sell by hand and put their own measurements on their site for each individual item they sell, including fitting notes the fabric and shape (should I order a size up or down if I'm in between measurements?).If a webshop can't provide that kind of service, I will not pay them. Instead, I have a few local store owners in my city I build a relationship with over the years. These owners are incredibly chill about ordering anything I might want to try on from whatever brands they typically carry. Typically, the items are the same price regardless of buying them online or offline, especially if you have to pay for shipping. It takes a while longer for the items to arrive to the store, but I'm happy with that, as it means supporting local businesses who actually offer service, opposed to a shit webshop. |||Great job! To be honest, I also think some people just fare better in Dutch culture than others, not as a result of their nationality, but simply personality. Some expats/immigrants/refugees just 'click' with how how the Dutch have subconsciously organized themselves socially and somehow intuitively know how to connect, while others just find themselves totally lost. |||I don't have endo, and my periods aren't by far as bad compared to many other women.. It's still quite painful, but at least I can still function and bite through the pain.When I'm on my period, by SO makes sure to cook and clean so I don't have to unnecessarily strain myself. He makes sure I'm comfortable by making me tea, builds me a pillow fort, asking if I need any additional hygiene supplies from the store, and simply is there for me. It's a small effort for him (any guy really)... you deserve the same, it's really not too much to ask for in a relationship. Especially when you do have endo that makes the pain severe.|||Welcome to the 21st century. The shit going down on this sub when it comes to women's agency makes me doubt whether this is actually a progressive sub... I see this a lot on subreddits that are 'non-conforming' to the Life Script stereotype. Take r/financialindependence for example. It's all nice and cozy with people supporting each other to live the life they want, until they start talk about 'how marriage will ruin you because women will steal every penny from your dead hands and there is absolutely nothing to gain from being married so don't even think about it'. There is a reason why they started a spinoff that focusses on women's perspective on this topic (r/FIREyFemmes if anyones interested) to get away from that stuff. The same here.. we all get together around a nice fire to eat some marshmallows and joke about how we couldn't do this if we had kids and how our life is better this way... until the argument dissolves into a 'omg a woman is breastfeeding in public, how dare she, that's gross' discussion. Like: what the fuck people?EDIT: fuck it, here you go, r/childfreewomen|||It might be a bit gross, but still awesome. Our bodies are pretty damn cool. Did you feel the capsule under your skin? Are you planning on someday replacing the magnet?|||Prepare before hand. Read the material on that day's lecture, and if they are available, look through the slides. During lecture, *do* take notes. I think by now, there is enough scientific backing that writing things down by hand greatly improves your ability to remember it. But don't worry about writing neatly, or about writing down everything. Write down the point in the lecture that made you think 'oh, that's why!' or 'wait, this is tough, what's happening'. The trick is to take your crappy notes you made during the lecture, and *rewrite* them, with slides and material at hand, into a good summary. This summary is not merely a summary of the material, but much more a summary in which you *explain* the material in a way you understand it best. This is why you take notes on those 'aha' moments during lectures, and not simply note every basic thing, because those are the points you should focus on when you truly want to understand what you're doing.|||Ok, your comment has given me more insight. I guess it's difficult to learn if you don't have anyone to turn to as well.. For example, I was gifted some premium steak some months ago, but I had no clue how to properly cook steak, as I never bought it myself (expensive!). I called up my dad who's is ridiculously good at cooking steaks and I was like 'daaad... what do I need to do?'. And because we cooked together plenty of times, he also knew to give me pointers regarding stuff he figured I specifically would have issues with. If you don't have (social) resources like that.. yeah, I get that it can be difficult. Thanks for taking your time to answer my question.|||Awesome! I currently have both the Chinese and English Harry Potter books sitting next to me because I am preparing to start deep reading the book as well. I don't care much about pronunciation (my language goals are more passive skills based) but it's really good to see somebody else managed! My Chinese is by far not good enough to read something like this comfortably but that's exactly the point. I was worried about whether it would be too much of challenge, so this post really came at a good time for me!I might shoot you an email later to get a copy of the sheets once I get to a desktop computer.|||So... do you speak any of the local languages? I'm guessing global public health isn't a field that has jobs for the taking, and I'm guessing most jobs will be (governmental, institutional) policy related. Not knowing the language will make your chances pretty small. If you don't know the language yet up to a decent level, I can guarantee you you won't get your proficiency up during your 1 years masters, or even during a 2 year masters, to a level required. If you already have some decent proficiency, that 1 or 2 years might be enough to get you to fluency.|||Your post brought back an idea I had a few months ago and didn't give too much thought. I speak a bunch of languages, but im not using them enough.. I figured I should get some subscriptions to newspapers in those languages to keep up. I'll be revisting that idea.|||People are being a bit harsh on you..  I get what you are saying. I'm a very neurotypical person who's together with someone who has anxiety (and episodes of depression).There is very much a difference between using your SO as a crutch and using them for support. I've been through both with my SO. There were times where he was so deep into his anxiety he would just throw his hands in the air, sit in a the proverbial corner, and tell me I *had* to make that call because he *can't*. And... I actually did, reinforcing his anxiety driven belief that indeed he was helpless and couldn't do it himself. Obviously this kind of defeatist attitude got him nowhere and his therapist put him back on track of actually dealing with his anxiety. Don't get me wrong, he still finds it incredible tough at times, but he does try and we give each other a hugs and high fives when he manages. But there are still times when he has particularly bad days and  will come to me and tell me: darling, my mind is not working, would you please mind doing this for me? The difference now being that the day after, he tells me: thank you for helping me out, obviously, my head got in my way and I'm going to focus on x or practise with y the next days yo get back on track.It *really* depends on the specific circumstances whether an act like making voice calls for your SO is you being a crutch or not.|||Before you go off into the wild and start making all kinds of trackers, *carefully* evaluate why you want to track any of the ideas you come up with. In my opinion, the word 'manage' in manager applies to the person carrying the title, not the members in the team. If you make a 'one on one' tracker for a specific team member, make it about *your* duties in relationship to that person, not about the duties of that person. If you're not careful, doing tracking for the sake of adding a tracker (without carefully evaluating the 'why'), might result in micromanagement of your employees, instead of managing your job as a manager. |||Clearly you are a caring, kind, and giving person. It shows in how you talk. The thing with 'your kind of people' is you always consider mitigating circumstances of *others*, but never stop to think about whether others do the same for you. You *also* have health issues, but your brother doesn't seem to bother taking that into account. I'm not saying cut him out of your life forever, but I do believe that at one point, if you have been giving and considerate for a long, long time, and the other person in the relationship does not return the favour.. maybe it is OK for you to do also scale back a bit.|||I made the trade-off between cum laude and multiple degrees. I did two BSc degrees which were somewhat related and maintained a 7.3 average. I also made sure to make time for extra curriculars though... I also did pretty amazing on both theses projects (9 on both), which *really* helped sell my decent but not stellar GPA. I'm also doing multiple MSc degrees at the moment, which is going pretty well. It is doable, but I made a very conscious choice not to get a side job (not possible with the work load) and take out a bunch of loans. Also, I never really was the hard core party type, but that also wouldn't really go together well with the work load. I do like to visit pubs and have nights together with friends, but that's maybe once a week or so, because I need most of my evenings for studying. I do make time for sports (typically 2x 45 min a week), but I must admit, this is also the first thing to go when I'm struggling for time. I have never regretted my choices, BUT I knew what I was getting myself into. It was definitely hard work and required a lot of discipline and planning, and it also required quite some sacrifices (although I wouldn't call them sacrifices, rather choices I made). I never tried to get into a top tier uni, but my resume is definitely competitive with similar 'super high achiever' goals. |||Honestly, I don't know. I'm just asking the question to filter what exactly builds up your argument / emotions. Reading through the lines of your other comments, I think one of your major issues is also how the adderall users think about how the drug fits in the societal context. I mean, if adderall would be freely available and general societal use of the drug would be like coffee: use when needed, in moderation, so you avoid all the bad stuff like hart palpitations and uncontrolled shaking.. I can imagine you'd might have less of a problem with it. But if that's the case, your problem is not the use of drugs as study enhancers, but rather the current culture or mindset that to succeed in this world, our generation needs to be the best at everything, at every time disregarding all costs it might ask of an individual (emotionally, mentally, physically, economically...) that leads to these attitudes surrounding drug use.

If you don't take it, you will never know what it's like outside of your current industry. Maybe you'll enjoy this new industry way more, and you don't even want to go back once you tried something else.|||I consider myself a nihilist as well, though my reasoning takes a different turn: if there is no point to existence, there is also no inherent value to humans inhabiting the universe either.

Rain, hail, ice, snow etc. The bag faced all of it on my daily bike commute. Anyway, it held up amazingly. It has a body strap as well by the way! It has a laptop and a tablet sections that is padded, so I just throw in my laptop and off I go. It looks good on any outfit, it is both a very classic model but definitely does not look outdated in real life, the leather is beautiful, and a little care (some wax once or twice a year) goes a loooong way. Also, it has an extra strap on the bag for when you're traveling so you can attach it to your suitcase handle. Amazing for long airport walks! |||You definitely found out which colours work well on your skin tone!In terms of your CCW: I like your silhouettes, but then I get down to your shoes, and I'm not feeling it.. If you would wear some classic black leather pumps with most of the outfits in your album, you would have go from 'I have no dress code at work but I think it's important to put *some* business in casual' to 'I am a kick-ass business woman who knows how to keep it casual'. You use silhouettes that do consciously try to hide parts of your body and shape your body in the way you like, and you definitely do a good! Your silhouettes already try to make you look less tall, so actually wearing some classic pumps would make a really nice contrast. Also: own you're tallness! Seriously, you don't need to dress down your height, you don't look disproportionate due to your height (as you might feel/think) at all!|||This hit hard. I'm one of those people who did 'everything right': worked hard and developed discipline to get multiple in demand diplomas, relevant work experience through my time at college, shit ton of worthwhile extracurriculars.. my graduation and job was quite literally on the horizon, I just need to finish my thesis. And now my long term SO got seriously ill and I have to postpone my graduation because I'm at home taking care of him. I got sooo close and I have a really hard time dealing with the fact that my success is halted because of outside factors. I'll get there eventually, no problem, but at the moment, it stings pretty bad.|||I'm not saying societal pressure in the form of shame is the best or even a good method, but you can't deny the results socetial pressure had on smoking. Smoking went from 'normal' to frowned upon, and the number of people who smoke dropped tremendously. If you are willing to put obesity and smoking in somewhat of a similar category (like you already mentioned in your reply), you can't just say \\\"I'm not sure if it would help\\\" without a compelling reason as to why over-eating and smoking are fundamentally different addictions, because clearly, it did have the intended effect on people who smoke.|||Something I broadly recommend to those with a love for humanities but a knack for STEM: you should consider artificial intelligence. AI as an academic field has *many* sides to it. Some universities focus on linguistics, using AI to analyze texts (both modern and historic) or developing intuitive language algorithms, etc. Others focus more on the 'artificial brain' which has a link to psychology, biology, medicine, etc. There are many others links to make when you think about big data opportunities in economics and other 'soft' fields. |||That's great! I'm in my 20s now, and my teenage years were god damn awful with my parents having a very ugly divorce (they still don't talk without lawyers present 10+ years later), and them finding new partners. There was a lot of stress, insecurity and fear in my life on top of going through puberty and I never really bonded with my step mum because if it. Once if left for uni however, I regained a lot of peace in my life, which made it easier to open up to her as well. Definitely keep reaching out to them, and see if they would be up for some one on one activities when they visit back home again for you to bond some more over the next years. The coming years might be the best to come!|||Nice, this gave me some good ideas to try out at some time. I typically keep a week list with stuff that needs to be done some time this week, next to daily lists for those few items that need to be done either on or before a specific day.I like this concept of having a running list of items and still being able to appoint them to certain specific days through the box position. If this work, I might be able to skip those daily lists all together.|||I think most (if not all) ENTJs go through this process when growing up. The fact that you already realize at your age that this behaviour is upsetting to people and you need to find ways to change your approach because this isn't getting you what you want, is really amazing. Some ENTJs grow up never really valuing self reflection, and thus never really put in the effort to learn this skill. My opinion: it's one of the most important skills, especially for an ENTJ. Not only for yourself, but once you get into a relationship with someone, you NEED these self reflective skills and abilities to build up your relationship and have it become strong and enduring. Ok, back to your question. Point 1: Even after you're 'an adult', there will still be people who think and act mostly based on emotion. And that's ok. It's different than how we think and do, but their way is **equally valid**. Understanding that your way is not necessarily the ubiquitous best way of being and doing, although you are absolutely convinced it is (because it is the best way *for you*) is the first step in toning down your 'perceived arrogance'. Does your high school have classes in philosophy? Take it! It will help you see things from different perspectives.Point 2 (which follows from one):Be wary of correcting flaws which you would perceive as flaws, but aren't actual objective flaws. Also consider who's flaws you're correcting. If it's good friends, lovers, or family: yes, call them out on their shit (more on that later) if they are really fucking things up. But for many others... I don't know, there is much to be said about learning how to do an internal eye roll and just shut the fuck up about things. Time and energy can only be spend once, treat it as a valuable resource. Also ask yourself: why do you feel the *need* to constantly correct everyone?Now, point 3 about communication and also related to ENTJs are quick to fill in the blanks (which is what makes us hyper efficient), but by doing so, we often superimpose our own perspectives, ideas, emotions etc unto others... which are often incorrect when we discuss someone else's situation or thoughts. Personally, I have gained tremendous emotional/interpersonal growth when I learned how to properly use the Socratic method in my conversations. Lead the conversation by asking questions, speak less, listen more. And when I say listen, I mean, truly listen and truly try to understand their mind. This is way more difficult than it looks and requires quite a bit of patience (another skill not easy for ENTJs to master)... The Socratic method is often used to have your speaking partner find fault in their line of thinking on their own, but by doing so and going really more in depth about *what the other is thinking, feeling, perceiving* I realized that what I thought they were thinking, feeling, perceiving really wasn't the case in many situations. This also broadened my own perspective of things, which helped me develop more as a person.With all of this in mind, I want to comment on this little bit:Yes, if you get into college, you'll likely find yourself draw to people who take on the same major etc. These people will indeed have similar interest, and maybe even more similar personalities to you. However, you shouldn't want that for yourself. If you only seek out those that fit you and your personality, you're putting yourself in a bubble. Yes, it's really difficult to connect with others that are really different from you, it really really is... but nothing of worth is easy to get. It's a struggle, but that struggle will make you grow as a person, and will - later on in life - make you a better manager/engineer/physician/whatever your life goal is.|||See my other comment on getting in touch with your emotions. My opinion: no, not at all. BUT: this is exactly one of those situations that require some serious emotional reflection and emotional maturity to not have it negatively influence your life (which will work against reaching your goals). |||How is your relationship with your scandinavian ex employer by the way? Any chance you could contact them and see if they have any contacts or relations (or would know someone down where you are who does) which they could put you up with?

Use it to see if you can build some contacts and maybe get a placement as a cadet throuhg networking.Also, please dont feel like you're 'taking a job away from the kids', you have just as much right to those jobs as they do. Im just thinking, you potentially have *more* value to bring than the kids.. so maybe there are ways to leverage your position and get a *better* entry point than the average 20 something year old could have.|||Exactly this kind of madness is why I ended up with an INTP SO in my life.|||In my city we have a second hand franchise store which only sells in season, undamaged, *nice* clothes. Every franchise owner picked a charity to which they donate the profits. Women can bring in clothes, they pick only those items that are of high enough quality to sell, if they sell something the woman who brought in the clothes gets 40 % of the sale price back, the remainder goes to pay staff etc, profit goes to their chosen charity. I *love* that shop, as it allows me to buy higher end brands for cheap, be sustainable, but also allows me to enjoy regular retail services.Maybe your city has something similar?|||The going to the bathroom analogy is amazing! I've been thinking how to explain what type of communication is wanted and not while I'm taking my time and space to work through emotions.. This works perfectly.

But then again, my eating habits and work out habits have been pretty consistent throughout the years at either end of my weight spectrum, just not when I was bed bound due to my injury. |||I think the emphasis is on the word 'team'. I think our situation is 'lucky' in the sense that we have been together since I was 18 and he was (very) early 20s and we were still in undergrad. He's turning 30 soon and has finished his studies and has entered working life, while I'm on the brink of finishing grad school. We quite literally built our life *together*. We have both been through shit (serious physical illness, mental illness, family problems, etc etc) and we both have taken the back seat regarding our individual progress and success to help out the other person. From quite a young age it was 'us' and not 'you and me' and we actively planned our lives around us being a team. I'm beyond happy about how strong our relationship is. We both raise each other up and our dynamic is very much about supporting and facilitating the other as best as we can. We always say: give 60% of yourself to the other and only take 40% back, that way, there always enough to go around and the excess is either used for continuously working on the relationship itself or when one of us needs additional care. This mentality also makes sure we never become codependent on each other and forces us to take a careful look at our support system outside of our relationship.Ok, I got a bit off tangent when writing that paragraph, anyway: We came from nothing and we both had nothing when we got together. All success since has been a shared effort. From this perspective, I also have absolutely no issue splitting assets 50/50 if we ever were to break up, even if he would become a SAHH (we don't want children) and he wouldn't have an income at all. Why? Because him becoming a SAHH would be a shared decision between the two of us because it would make sense for *our* lives and his personal growth. Because we push each other so much in terms of personal growth and living our lives the best we can, I would never feel he wouldn't somehow equally contribute to *our* lives if he were to be a SAHH. IMHO, I also think knowing assets will be divided equally between working and non-working partner is essential for the non-working partner. Access to funds is paramount, because money is power - also in a relationship - and I want my SO to never feel a financial hostage in our relationship. This (feeling of) financial freedom for both partners is fundamental to a healthy relationship if you ask me.Example financial discussion we had some months ago: because of some financial setback, my SO had to deplete close to all of his savings to be able to finish his last year of grad school and cover the few months between graduation and employment. When he got a job, we discussed our finances (which are separate, except for shared expenses like food and rent) and whether it would make sense for him to contribute more now that he had a full time job (this is him giving more towards our relationship than he is taking). I told him that in principle I agreed and it wouldn't make sense for me to take on more debt if his income could cover most expenses, but because he had no savings left to speak of, I wanted him to first built up a proper emergency fund for himself again with his new salary before he started to pay more towards shared expenses (which is me giving more to the relationship than I'm taking). |||For me: I love technology, but yeah, I decided I don't necessarily love being an engineer... I took on a second degree on the side in business administration/management next to my engineering degree, figuring I'd rather go into (engineering/technology) management instead of being an engineer. But here's the deal: I didn't *quit* my engineering degree, because the title it will give me means I can get a foot in the door like nothing else can. Especially in my country, female engineers are hard to come by, and companies are hard pressed to get them to sign with them. *Engineers* who have the skill set of an engineer *in addition* to other in demand skills have serious potential in terms of pay and career opportunities. tl;dr: being an engineer opens up career opportunities far beyond the engineering field itself, that's why it's worth it. |||Go check out /r/skincareaddiction Crazy people who have tried every crazy potential solution under the sun.

I'm chipped myself and I definitely think it's a good thing to make sure institutions (public or private) are banned from using any kind of force or power to demand or require those who belong to the institution to be chipped.

Many universities actually do this. The first year diploma is called propedeuse and you get it after successfully completing all first year courses. So maybe with a mechanical engineering HBO (Dutch neme for unis of applied science) propedeuse will give you access to a Dutch WO mechanical engineering degree. Although, it does mean starting over from year one at WO, you can't carry the credits overYou should also realize that HBO is much more practical education. You can expect to have hands on practicals where you learn how to actually *be* a mechanical engineer, while WO is much more theoretical.|||I know quite a few INTPs and I wouldn't call any one of them 'submissive'. Maybe less vocal or showing less of an outward presence, but definitely not mentally, emotionally, personally submissive. I have found INTPs - although not quick to declare anything definitively - are quite strong (or maybe better, robust) in their core personality regarding what they know and believe, both rationally and emotionally (even if underdeveloped). That's why I find it difficult to see INTPs as being abused by a more outwardly dominant partner.. They know who they are and what they are inside from a very multifaceted and layered perspective, and pushing and shaking them from the outside won't change that as that big web of knowledge, considerations and constructs is quite difficult to break down to the core. |||CCW'ing because the more business casual outfits on your board are very much my style: lots of these pins depend on waist accenturation.

I think this style looks really good on larger bodies as well and it's definitely a good style that can carry you through your weight loss journey.Maybe it's because you are a bit self conscious about your weight, but you don't really show any of those business cadual silhouettes you show on your board at all in your outfits. You seem to put a lot of effort in hiding your tummy area, but - at least from what I can see - it doesn't seem very necessary... Your pants are quite skinny, do you have a straight skirt or maybe some palazzo pants? Maybe even a more A line skirt? Anything that doesn't hug your legs and can be used as a counterweight to a more flowy top or blouse that can be tucked at the waist. You can definitely pull off something like it, both at your current weight and all the way down to your goal weight.|||Oh, yes, we've all been through what you're explaining, however, this stood out to me from OPs post:If your field is a fit with you as a person, this type of apprehension is *not* normal. I've seen so many people like OP who, in the end, decided to switch either to another STEM programme or something different all together. These people typically found a new field that simply 'clicks' better with their intuition and they regained all that joy they once had for studying and learning new stuff.If it's not working out for you, try something else, maybe it's just not the best fit for your talents. This is not a bad thing, or even a value judgement. Quite the opposite: going through a journey like this.. I'd say it will benefit you a lot, both academically and in terms of personal growth.|||Enjoy your new addication!

One thing I started doing is actually vocalizing my discomfort. I had a bunch of 'bigger incidents' with my SO like you are describing, but most of the clumsiness also comes in the form of him for example wanting to give me an excited bear hug and twisting my arm in the process. So now, the moment I start feel physical discomfort (not even pain) I will simply say: ouch! with loudness and intensity corresponding with the amount of discomfort. This made him learn pretty quickly that the actual 'physical mistake' that leads to hurting me is not always the same movement or situation that ends up actually hurting me. Another thing that helped *tremendously* is him picking up martial arts. He always loved sports, but since he started doing martial arts we has learned to control his body extremely well. This combined with him learning what is hurting me has reduced both small and big incidents to a point I can't say I'm bothered by it any more. |||One of the toughest life lessons to learn and internalize is that you can change no-one, only yourself. Nor do you have responsibility for anyone (except for when you have children) but yourself.You can't change your dad, especially not as a 14 year old kid. I know that sucks. That being said: start taking care of you the best you can. You note that you're overweight. At 14, you are at a perfect age to start getting fit and healthy. That's something fully in your control, even if your dad is the one that's cooking. Also, focus on school, make sure you put in the work and get good grades, so you can get a good degree that allows you the comfort to work a job that won't break you like your dad's job did to him, and not worry about finances like your dad has to worry now. I get wanting a job to have some extra cash, but as a teenager, you'll not earn a lot and it truly will only be a drop in the bucket to your family's finances. Focus on your health and school first, and earning a bit of extra cash second. Having your health and school in order will pay of 1000 fold more 10 years from now than earning some extra bucks right now.|||Ok, this is hitting close to home and is pushing one of my personal frustration buttons. I'm Dutch born and raised, atheist, and my full lineage is European. I also volunteer my time to mentor Syrian refugees and help them with their Dutch language skills and their integration in Dutch society. Yes. Definitely. Absolutely true. Here's my problem: What are you (generic you, as in the society as a whole) doing to help them blend in and integrate? All refugees I've met come over with an extreme willingness to blend in and be part of our culture, with an extreme thankfulness for being able to build a life in safety in our country. But EACH AND EVERYONE of them says the same: I try *so, so hard* to connect with the Dutch, but they are a closed off people who are extremely difficult to befriend. I feel they don't want me here, even though I try. So what happens? This people build friendships with other Arabs who *do* welcome them instead. Resulting in them speaking mostly Arabic in their homes instead of Dutch, resulting in their children being raised with mostly Arabic influences at home, but going to Dutch schools when they are a bit older (usually with language deficiencies due to being raised with Arabic). And when these kids grow up, they find themselves split between 'being Arab' and 'being Dutch'. Being conflicted about your cultural identity leads to this kind of extremist thoughts and feelings, simply because you *want to belong*. So again: what are *you* doing to help these people be part of our society?|||Do you want to become a scientist? If yes, it's easier to get into engineering research from a chemistry background than vice versa.If not, and your major concern is future career, I would recommend chemical engineering. Even if you end up having a passion for chemistry and want to go into research, you could still do a more chemistry related PhD and end up in R&amp;D, while it's quite difficult for a chemist to get into engineering fields. It's possible, but more difficult.. also, assuming you want to stay in Spain: engineering is simply a safer bet for actually being able to find a job in your country.If you want something nice that combines the two: find a university that focuses on product engineering (opposed to *process* engineering). You'll get your engineering degree while still playing around with loads of actual chemistry.Source: chemeng graduate student with a SO who is a chem graduate (and now looking for a job).|||I know you're not OP, but still curious: what is your definition of success and - in opinion the more interesting questions - why does achieving success equate to worth (or value) for you as a person and/or society?|||So, just as a thought experiment: if adderall were an over the counter or easy available med from a physician (not saying it should be, or ever will be), would your problems with their use in an academic study go away?|||By the way, about Disney.. I'm European, so that makes travel a bit easier. My parents were pretty well off financially (and not bothered with FI) when I was growing up until the crisis hit, and we would visit Disney Paris every year during the spring holidays. But we had a deal: we would visit Disney for 1 or 2 days, but we would also spend 3-4 days in Paris itself. I seriously think I've seen *all* of the major museums and other cultural hot spots in Paris by the time I was 10.  They also had a nature/technology play museum build for kids which I absolutely *loved* and visited several times over the years. It was a great thing really. Sure, Disney was amazing, and I loved it back when I was young, but to attach a more wholesome and cultural part to the trip overall makes me think back of those times even more fondly now that I am grown up. \"\n",

If you want to be \\\"specific\\\" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.If you're saying \\\"crow family\\\" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens.So your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people \\\"call the black ones crows?\\\" Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too.Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family. But that's not what you said.

Mainly for gear I would worry about shields, I would highly suggest a roid shield or the Firehawk nova shield. A transfusion grenade is also a great thing to throw out if you are in cover and need a quick heal.One fatal skill is the one that extends the action skill timer, that screwed me over the most. The action skill restores your hp to 100% and halves damage so naturally you want to use it as much as possible. I believe if your health is below 30% and you have the middle skill tree capstone it also removes cooldown on your skillLinking your gear would be helpful, especially your skill build. If you're already maximizing on Kreig's insane regeneration abilities then I'm not sure.|||Definitely great advice. I can confidently play about four characters, which means I can essentially cover everyone if my team is missing somebody. Catherine, Adagio, Koshka, and Vox are characters I play pretty well, usually leading double+ of my kills or assists depending on the character. From playing them I know most of their flaws. Playing Adagio made me realize how useful a reflex block is, which improved me a shit ton. Catherine made me realize it's important to take what your team needs rather than what you want. Vox let me learn how to adapt easily. And Koshka made me realize how important it is to work with your teammates.|||I JUST DID, I'M STILL IN HYPE MODE FROM THE NEW EPISODE.|||I am planning on becoming a genetic engineer, but I understand how some people could view it negatively.

I binged last weekend and every episode had me begging for me.Personally, Myriad colors left me disappointed after watching Erased. It just felt so empty and lots of the characters felt so bland and one dimensional. Yeah they had personal problems, but they all seemed not very personal and something that was added just so they could solve the problem of whatever phantom they were currently dealing with.

Jon refused because he didn't want to be indebted and feel the need to do favors/repay the king for such a huge gift. \\\"Would this be less pathetic because it's a different show?

Skaarf's goop pool is effective defense against Kestrel since it forces her out of stealth and you can lock her out of it with Skaarf's DOT from his fireballs. She is insanely squishy and wont last long from burst taka if he goes into his box before engaging to get the jump on her. Most Kestrel players are trying to play her like Ringo, but positioning her outside of the main fight is a must otherwise they will lose.

Don't hear people bitching about how the original didn't have a bunch of features.Seriously, you guys need to calm down, this isn't Battlefront 3, I wish it was.

I frequently see this one team that I always choose to fight because I know they'll be easy. It is a team that is essentially nothing but tanks. STHan(L), RG, Fives, and I think another tank+Rey.

They should at least be giving T2 something special because right now they're just more expensive T1 skins. Ideally we could give T2 some special effects and T3 could have exclusive voice lines.

You can tap yourself to drop a decoy where you're standing or tap a different area on the screen to drop a decoy and make it walk to where you tapped. Basic attack would be a crossbow to keep up with the theme of a hunter. Very Slow attack speed with fast projectile travel that does good damage. Hero perk would be where you have increased energy regeneration and ability cool down decreased when outside of combat. If you initiate combat (no damage taken) your first basic attack does 15% more damage. I'm not sure what an ult could be. A hero that punishes people who take bait and face check would be great. Would probably have slow movement speed as well.|||It is probably just low elo or maybe the meta is just really garbage. I dropped ranked mode when they separated visual elo from actual and changed the rank names.

I use to love it a decade ago but I tried playing it several months ago and I couldn't stand it. Half the time they were sleeping or at school/work and the other half the time they were behaving in such a retarded fashion that I just started drowning the little shits. Maybe if you could interact with them at work or school instead of just fast forwarding it would be more interesting. Plus building relationships with other sims is literally just mashing the \\\"tell joke\\\" or \\\"hug\\\" button till the meter is full.It just isn't as engaging as other games and the parts that do are just trying to queue up actions as fast as possible. I can understand why people like it, I used to love the game but a lot of consumers need interactive games. I don't know, maybe I wasn't playing it right but that is how I view the lack of interest in the game.|||Yep, definitely fan service. Nobody really would've cared for Izumi, as we didn't meet her, it's the main reason everyone liked General Iroh.

I think it sucks that they did it last year but not this one.They lack consistency, which is frustrating. I still have those stupid 12 Days of Spring in my achievement list and that won't ever come back.Info would be great but you have to realize that the double drops benefit everyone including CG. They lack good communication as well, like you mentioned. But some of their moves are particularly scummy, like making the R2 event the shortest of all the rare events so that players can't use a newly unlocked Palpatine to get him.|||Superbad is an amazing movie! Another tip would be Scott Pilgrim as well has similar themes to Superbad.|||They're making it too easy to want him to be the one dead.

Although for the blade to be equally as effective as a light saber it would require the sonic vibration battery which would probably negate the advantages metal benders would have due to it vibrating crazy fast. Not to mention wielding this weapon comes at a severe risk to the user since it puts metal benders at a greater risk of lightning due to the blade being highly conductive and could cause the battery in the sword to explode which could take the user's life with it if unfortunate. If metal bending is particularly hard to learn I imagine the intense vibrations would make it almost impossible to manipulate the metal of the blade|||I feel somebody should post a certain copy pasta involving a spork.|||You're quite the stickler Meeseeks, aren't you.|||I'm glad that it's good for you guys, my guild isn't doing so hot.

I have HRScout at 7* and CLS at 7* and I have been working on HRSoldier for about a month, I think I may be the most prepared for TB even though I have been urging my guildmates to be prepared for weeks. I'm starting to think it's time I resign from the guild and move on, we have 41 members but our guild doesn't even have 29 million galactic power. This is honestly a very depressing gamemode for smaller guilds and I think it will kill lots of smaller guilds which is really unfortunate.|||It makes me cry when teammates don't build defense. My friend IRL is pretty bad with his builds, rarely buys the right defensive item. Just stupid stuff like that, but it still is slightly frustrating. Defense is so important in this game, it sucks when you have teammates who don't even attempt to build it. Anyway, I found a good counter to those who burst while juggling. I know I may get some flak for this, but it works like 90% of the time. If they start bursting I will intentionally last hit, this nets your some early/mid game gold and they will *usually* try and last hit from you. Which, is what you want them to do. They do it out of rage/annoyance and you get the right dynamic going between the support/jungler.Bursting becomes ridiculously annoying once I buy my stormguard banner (I can't remember if that is the actual name) and I can essentially 3 shot every creep. But my method usually works and allows you to jungle more efficiently, despite the scummy part of stealing a few last hits.|||I wasn't wandering for two hours, I had to sit there after being caught. I honestly didn't try much of a strategy. Just your naive stuff. Either way, I was a dumbass and clearly shouldn't have attempted.

A rich person buying a somebody a $50k car requires no sacrifice, because they're rich right? But Harry, somebody with literal stacks of golden coins that fill a vault, has his gifts have more value for what reason? As for the sarcastic comment, I didn't not say such a thing. I stated Harry was rich, this is a fact.

Although it depends on how long the event is up. For 100 crystals you could get 24 stun cuffs, plus the daily energy you get from logging in at certain times and normal energy regen. So that is 24+(45(3)/10) which is around 35 salvage and then you could add the normal energy regen. There would be a certain threshold where the crystal expense on energy would be much more expensive than outright buying them but I imagine the guy who said he would buy 10k energy worth of crystals wasn't being literal. Either way, that is one stun cuff for a fraction of the price depending on how many refreshes you buy. I think this could benefit CG as consumers would be more likely to buy a bunch of energy refreshes and could eventually spend more than they would have buying them in shipments.|||Honestly, I doubt most people do that for humor.

I won't comment on how annoying it was to read that due to errors such as intwll8gent and we'recommend. I have to ask what that last one means, is it we recommend or we're commend? Your comment about energy conservation and thermodynamics doesn't make sense. I'm assuming your message is about ghosts or aliens or something?Almost all of our energy originates from the Sun and the Sun gives off lots of heat.  Heat is a form of energy. Small animals and insects eat plants which use the Sun as a direct source of energy. We eat large, small, and medium animals along with plants. We, like the sun, use **a lot** of our energy generating heat. I believe it's above 70% of the energy we consume gets turned into heat. Heat likes to spread outwards towards cold areas. So the energy you turned into heat is now being transferred from you to somewhere else immediately. When you die your body stops generating heat and it disperses around you. The energy used to create your skin and body as a whole will be consumed by other entities such as bacterium or other animals. These entities will be consumed by something else until it repeats the cycle. No energy is wasted. All energy is recycled.TL;DR is that you shouldn't use your lack of knowledge on basic concepts to try and rationalize spooky ghosts that have no concrete evidence of even existing and then trying to propagate it to others.|||Poor Nia, telling GG to all her teammates through her name.|||Probably the best scenario that has happened.Don't worry, we cut a bitch.|||Have to find a change of pants at home, to restore your honor.|||K2-S0 whenever he gets released.

I think I missed her character.|||Yeah, people always say he should change based off of who he is under but that doesn't make sense. Revan was never a follower, Revan and The Exile both held strong influence over the people around them and their companions were practically compelled to follow them. Revan should have a strong leader ability, a weak basic, and two powerful specials and a unique. His basic should be similar to Sabine's in that it has a chance of hitting multiple times per attack, similar to how his Flurry skill worked. His unique should be something that allows him to switch between defensive and offensive. On his turns he recieves 50% offense, 15% potency, 15% crit chance, 10% crit damage, and 10% health steal. Once his turn ends he loses these stats and gains 75% defense, 50% tenacity, 25% crit avoidance, and 20 speed.This makes him vulnerable to counter attack teams and could make Gar Saxon a useful farm. The speed also allows for him to set off Rex's leader a little bit more often which could be detrimental but it won't be an issue because of his leader. Special 1 is Lightning Storm: Deal damage to each enemy and have a % chance to apply shock. If this attack scores X critical hits then lower/remove the cooldown. Lightning storm was a very useful ability that I think was used a lot even if you played light side Revan, it was also incredibly fun and easy to spam. Special 2: Target ally recieves X buffs and is called to assist, if the attack is a critical hit then targeted enemy recieves an equal amount of debuffs. Revan had close allies, I imagine certain classes would recieve different buffs. Characters like HK could receive retribution and a guaranteed revive, it is somewhat similar to Hera's ability. Leader Star Forge: When an opposing character is supoosed to gain turn meter from an ability or other means (Leader abilities, uniques, etc) If the turn meter gain only effects one person it is not effected. The turn meter is then divided in half and randomly given to your team. Replace health steal with protection. This negates Rex and other TM based leaders, it keeps everyone essentially at the same turn order. It also gets rid of Zaul's biggest perk while also keeping characters like Jyn and Savage alive.|||Thread is over boys, go home.|||I actually can run somewhat fast and for a decent distance, I was top of my class when it comes to athletics.

These players would need to have ridiculous amounts of dedication, much more than just playing 10 matches in ranked to either drop or gain Elo to play with decently ranked people. No changes need to be made to the system SEMC has made.|||It is probably because he is a strong hero that has versatile roles. If a hero can cover CP and WP competently then they will be played.

If you really want to reroll your hero there is a button to do that.Personally, I like blind, one of the main reasons I don't play ranked is because I like the idea of fighting against the odds of a team that we didn't build to counter against.**Now** I do love your idea 110%!

Don't quote me on this though.|||I had to lane with Catherine when my friend had to go afk. As long as she doesn't start there she is fine, let her get a good item or two. I personally think a Warhorn ( or at least Stormguard Banner is a necessity for this since it gives you a great boost+regen in lane early game). I just built her as I normally would, but got superman levels tanky way faster than the enemy team was prepared for. Add in an aftershock, some infusions, and an item of your choice you become insanely powerful+tanky mid game. That being said, what I did was pretty lucky because they didn't know my teammate was afk and jungle invade. Stills was insanely fun, especially since Catherine's passive is insane if you constantly throw yourself into the action.|||Dang, hopefully they'll get the rest up soon.|||Yeah, damn kids these days and their weird acronyms.|||Jyn the main damage dealer? Her damage is mediocre compared to Chirrut and Cassian. You also have your Chirrut description wrong, he turns it into a heal over time rather than the reverse debuff which is General Kenobi's special. Chirrut and Cassian are damage dealers, Jyn allows you to control the flow of battle and shut down the enemy team's biggest threat. Also, K2's Zeta is that he gains 1% max protection whenever he takes damage. He doesn't regain it, his new max protection is 101% of its original value. So when combined with Jyn's lead he will regain 5% of 101% of his max protection, then 5% of 102%, and it continues. He has the potential to have the most health/protection out of anybody in the game. Although, in my opinion K2 and Baze shouldn't be on the same team since it gives the enemy an option on who to attack when they are taunting. R2 may give a better bonus to the team than K2 could.|||I like to watch School Days, it gets my blood boiling.|||Most likely he is 6 away|||Wait, why does it say you're four seconds into the game?|||I'm so confused, I agree it was great, but do you know what he said?|||The ass is where it is at.|||I got a legendary on my first glory draw.

Certainly that would get boring, opposed to Civ where there is constant evolution of strategy.I have nothing against you, and I didn't plan to offend anybody with that statement, but it just seems the comparisons you gave are between two drastically different games. Similar to comparing oatmeal to a burger, they just weren't meant to be in the same league.|||Just call it fuel or something like that.|||Looks like you have to do a solo game with Paras.|||Plus we need more Mortys to indoctrinate.

Can it improve something, yes it can, but if you need to be revived obviously things won't be the same.It also has been improved graphically and has destructible terrain. Pretty huge improvement compared to SBF1&amp;2. Of course it's going to lose features till they can figure out a way to properly implement them in a way that looks as beautiful as the actual game.|||So a quick few things Probably the best line of the episode, especially because it was so quick. Also, we have confirmation of Joker being sent to Arkham rather than being killed. This will allow for Harleen to be introduced assuming they follow Jerome as they have followed Penguin. We also have Bruce giving himself his defining trait that separates him from the baddies. It is pretty poetic, for lack of a better word I guess, that Penguin was returned to the docks again for his \\\"death\\\" so to speak.Overall the episode was pretty good, I wasn't a fan of Jerome being the Joker before but I am warming up to him after the past two episodes.Edit: Spelling, mainly heto to hero.|||I know you said it's cliche, but I have to say it made it more realistic.

My bad.|||Poor those who didn't get it, Kuvira was meant to be a parallel to Stallin or Hitler in WWII. Good intentions at first, saving her country from a huge blow, but got to ambitious. The main difference is that you can relate to Kuvira, mainly since we didn't  really see the things that were hinted at. Her *reeducation* camps could have been very problematic and were without a doubt a reference to concentration camps.Kuvira was an amazing character, but we it isn't just black and white like people like to paint out her character.

I am using an iPad to play, but have been transitioning to Android. Would love to be able to play on my phone when I'm out and don't have my iPad. Although they'd either need separate servers or we would have to wait longer for updates as the run on seperate code.One issue could be funding, but the skins update could fix that. Takes lots of resources to develop for two devices, keep multiple servers, etc. Plus they don't really have any advertisements.

I almost didn't make it as Elijah locked the door behind me. I used my high speech to get Elijah to come down and let me go, snuck past him after some trial, error, and countless deaths. The trick is waiting till he is almost in the vault to get past the shields. It was a huge pain but I am happy I got away with it. I then went to my home in Big Mountain and dropped off my loot there. It was tough but worth it.|||Of course. The Joker is a catalyst for chaos throughout Gotham. I think it'd be ideal to save him for the final season since he is on an entirely different level from all other Batman Villains. The Joker could be the final push for Bruce to put on the mask for this show. I personally hope The Joker doesn't get an official origin and he just appears one day. Gotham has fostered a habitat that allowed personas like Batman and The Joker to grow. I just hope they don't develop Jerome into The Joker as he lacks a certain something. He is crazy but he is just that when The Joker is so much more.|||I'm like 110% sure we will find another planet to inhabit.

As for the use for the human body please look up an Energy Flow graph as That demonstrates how we get energy from the Sun. I'm not sure what the earth's mass has to do with this, we are arguing about the law of conservation here which you don't seem to fully grasp. We still get almost all of our energy from the Sun, I once again direct you to an Energy Flow graph to demonstrate how. I never said that the Earth came from the sun as well, this is twice you have put words in my mouth. Your comment about my \\\"70%\\\" thing is actually incorrect. And I was incorrect as well, I severely messed up on that. We lose 90% of our energy. But you are correct, it isn't just *all* heat. About 90% of energy is lost between trophic levels due to not being ingested, not digested, lost as excrement, and lost as heat due to respiration. You were severely wrong though about energy not creating skin. Energy is everything around us. Everything we can see, touch, and even smell contains energy. If energy wasn't used to create skin then we would be creating something from nothing which isn't exactly possible.You're saying nothing will consume us when we die because we're top of the food chain. But last I checked a dead man can't defend all too well. We lose our immune system and our cells stop regenerating. Bacteria start eating away at us almost immediately. When we die something starts eating us immediately.

This visual reset is such BS. I get put into draft every ranked match but I don't have anything to show for it except for a \\\"trophy\\\" from season 1/2.

Seeing as with Celeste they essentially made her a pure Crystal character I think we need a pure defence. First ability is healing, similar to Adagio without the arcane fire.Second is a shield, similar to Ardan, just without the speed boost.

Later once we left I told him that he was interrupting that, in which case, he stated \\\"Yeah, why would she be flirting with you? You're not a 10/10 in ImaCuntVille.\\\" Nobody told him he was being shitty since he surrounds himself with people that will orgasm at his command.Was also at a party and one of my friends, my favorite, said I was probably the most attractive in the group (out of the guys) and he straight up said I couldn't be.

You are saying you want what's best for the sub and that we're community driven but your actions don't appear to show that. Clearly the community is frustrated at this and wasn't given any warning of this change.Frankly it appears you're trying to act as a parent which isn't your place. You make changes that upset the community and your only explanation is \\\"It's the best for everyone.\\\" That isn't an answer to our questions nor our frustrations. Reddit thrives because the users are able to control what they see and have an impact on the community. If you disregard that then you are willingly shooting yourself in the foot. My main concern is that for all the talk of bettering the community you seem to be ignoring what the community wants. You aren't our superior yet you don't talk to us like equals. You talk without telling us everything, without a proper explanation, when we our asking for answers you're essentially just telling us that you know best. |||It has also been 4 years since than, Bojack is old and then drugs definitely have made it worse.|||Jenny...?|||Would've made clean up hella hard.|||Boba probably, he is just too good of a character.

Speed is too important and they practically ignore it, they tried nerfing damage on faster characters but it feels like there was no difference. Auto taunters were probably one of the worst solutions since it was a way to profit off the flaw of their game and they knew it. Speed makes characters I would love to run in Arena completely useless which ruins half the game's roster.|||They said that this season would be spent up on building up the characters and their world.

I imagine Sokka would be having the spirit bombs set up like C4 and it wouldn't take much for the two geniuses to rig that system.Back to Vaatu, which is a spiritual God of sorts. Well team Avatar already has Raava, which has an equal power of Vaatu, but just in human/bender form.

(that was mine).|||Alliteration sure is sexy.|||Meant \\\"played with\\\" this makes it sound like I played the enemy. I had teamed up with SeaHawkGeek after having a great match with him and we won three matches in a row. **I can't thank SEMC enough for the new pings!** I'm certain that without them those games would've been a lot worse, but the pings kept everyone friendly and there wasn't any passive aggressive \\\"ok\\\"So big shout out to my great team and SEMC.|||Wait, what happened?|||They've actually started spreading into the U.S.A since last year.

I just call them the Northern Woods since Polaris sucks.Canon is also a good one.|||Exactly, like Magmatrooper is purely for magma.|||Marquee event but they apply offense down to Jar Jar and defense up. They give Jar Jar a bunch of health with a base 50%+ evasion and all of his other specials/unqiues increase the evasion. The Marquee event would generate so much annoyance and would be perfect for the 24 hour run to only get him to 3*-4* on April 1st.|||Dude, I wish I had that teacher. I fucking love borderlands, in top 3 game series easily. Didn't pay much attention in physics anyway...|||He was especially annoying. His build particularly, although I never bothered to target him since he never had enough damage output to really take anyone out. Mainly cleaned up anyone at low health when his teammates died.|||Mother like son.|||For anybody missing the reference [here you go. ](https://youtu.be/9dbi3--k4SM)|||Yeah, SEMC is aware of the bug. I'm more worried about when Koshka gets teleported to the lane after using an ability in center jungle.|||Skye/Blackfeather were popular in higher tiers too. They didn't nerf them because they're fine with skilled players having overpowered heroes. That's what annoys me.I remember when Petal would absolutely wreck shit way before her long list of nerfs/buffs. All they really have to do is decrease radius of where the munions can move, give them more 1.11 stats. That way melee heroes have a risk against her and ranged heroes don't have to worry about getting completely destroyed. With some more thoughts put into this I am sure she would end up viable without being OP.|||Why would anybody even try doing that?|||I always hated her since she was introduced.|||Fuck OP for putting the top answers in the thing. No point in reading the thread now.|||Huh, I'm not sure what I was expecting when I clicked on that.|||Yeah, her A plays very similar to Skaarf's A, so players who are used to Skaarf will probably have an advantage since she is really similar. I am loving the combo of her abilities, just need to figure out which WP and CP builds are good/fit my playstyle with her.|||Does nobody realize it's a minion? Or am I being whooshed?|||Ah, thanks for the input, /u/cuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuum|||Funny, I was worried it'd be the timey one.

It's best to trade things without leveling them up, that way you don't feel your time was wasted as much.|||He commented on this somewhere earlier. He took an actual IQ test and scored in the upper 130s. He lied about 150s but most high schools/colleged offer psych class so he probably took the class for a semester and labeled himself as Doctor Phil. He said he lied mostly because of insecurity and he had a bad break up.|||Cue mass murders caused by Taka and Koshka.|||I believe he is a captain of airships, so I guess that would make him a *Skye* pirate.|||Alternatively couldn't they use children of dieties? Greek gods banged a lot according to legend so having one famous champion with their parent being a diety could work.|||Sid was good for a while. Then he got nerfed. He was my second 7* hero. Such a waste of time that set me back after his nerf.|||Wasn't it because 4chan's /pol/ board ended up making a fanfiction about it and it got forwarded to some idiots reporter on Twitter who thought it was real?|||Umbara would have to be one if it was Clone Wars themed. You could even have CTs fight other CTs.|||I know, we're so lucky. *quietly sobs*|||It wasn't a matter of Jerome, it was a matter of The Joker. It was mainly due to writing which worried me and probably made me more critical of him then deserved. Not to mention I wasn't, and am still not the biggest fan of his laugh. It is a matter of opinion but I think he was handled pretty well in these past few episodes.|||I'm not sure which would have been worse. :(|||Damn,I can taste the salt. It would be good if you had some constructive criticism though.As for some heroes rocking and sucking, that's entirely on you and the enemy team. Learn to adapt, you sound like an autolocker tbh. Learn to get better at the game as you obviously haven't gotten very far.|||I just wish Team Instinct would go extinct. They ruin tournaments and are just general pains that seemingly control the game. If their complaints are what reportedly caused the almost instant change for mods then they hold too much power over CG imo.|||That always was my favorite episode, good to see others are getting joy out of it as well!|||When you wrote this you said you had just started reading the books, it is a few months later, have your opinions changed at all? People like Scott for the person he becomes not for who he is at the start. A lot of people can relate to his bad behavior on some level and they can see themselves in him at times which is why everybody here likes him. Anyway, opinion changes and other comments you may have?|||I mean, if she does know he is a fanhaus and likely knows he uses Reddit I wouldn't doubt that she could be using it as a way to give him a \\\"fuck you\\\" type deal. Not that I care but it certainly is a possibility.|||What's GLHF? Honestly, the hardest part is the syncing of characters, I already tried it in multiplayer and was doing pretty well.|||Infiltrator Ardan, dressed in Storm Guard attire would be cool as well.

I love Vainglory, but I hope mobile gaming isn't the main platform ever.

It encourages you to learn good timing for FoR so you get the most out of it.|||I think it because other media series use evil versions as nega. Nega Scott, Nega Sonic, etc. It is just a way to mean evil or shadow.|||First of all, Adagio is built for support yet is so much more. Seriously, he can carry if you play him right.Depending on your enemies it may be better just to harass them and let your junglers do their thing. This, if anything, allows them to invade the enemy jungle and starve the other team. It'd be better to have teammates who have farmed more and gave you a slight advantage, although they *should* respond to your pings if you are in need of support.|||Yeah, but the third one had a slight difference. Plus in that world there were multiple restarts for the human race, so it could've taken place during that time. I don't actually support the theory, as I'd have to be an idiot to do so.

Regular is where you don't really have to pay attention to weapon compatibility and can essentially be a god. True Vault hunter is where you have to start using the game mechanics. Ultimate is where you have to put everything you've learned to the test. Sadly it takes forever without editing your save to get all the way up to UVHM.

Time flies fast, I have just been remembering it as one year. Odds are that you either play little or spend a lot of glory/ice on card boxes. I know I am guilty of the latter.

But everyone was more concerned on building and scavenging since they just started.Streaming would be a terrible idea unless he was all alone on a server since it would literally be broadcasting his every movement. He couldn't do rad runs, he couldn't find a secret base location, if he was planning on raiding everyone would have a heads up. This especially holds true since most people on the whitelisted server are yog or just sips fans. It's harder to stream this game, especially if he gets a code lock, then he would have to either interrupt stream to punch in his codes or make his base insanely easy to get in to.|||Oh, I saw some of Tennants stuff but not a lot of it. I have seen Blink, guess I didn't pay enough attention. That line felt very childish, which was common and understanble, they're trying to appeal to a younger audience.

Once it starts seeing a pattern it just starts shortening the time it takes process what you're seeing. It's just allowing your brain to fill in what your eyes are missing/taking too long to process. Why do all the work it takes to process everything from anew, when you can cut the work in half? It's similar to how in movies/tv they show all the pathways in your brain, but you brain just starts rearranging those paths to get to the destination faster.TL;DR The gif isn't going faster, you are.|||That would kind of suck.

Granted if it lasted any longer we would've been stomped.You shouldn't have 2 designated laners, like your strategy, a laner and a Roamer are best.

Asteroids blow up into smaller debris, instead of just fire effects and a texture change you could physically see the bridge being torn down. See their airlocks ripped apart. Something amazing as well, you won't just have a small area for the hangar, you'll get the entire ship. An entire ship to attack, destroy, sabotage, place hidden spawn points. Imagine taking a vehicular transport ship and setting up bases on the flying giant asteroids. Can you imagine all these features, pretty amazing, so when this game sells amazingly it will get a sequel. If DICE does it right a game will come out every few years, me one game every three. They created Battlefront on their engine from scratch, of course it is going to lack features.

This is the character that they feel the most confident/competent with. Most good players will adjust which hero they play to balance their team so it's even.

The voiced character not only made giving big dialogue trees something Bethesda didn't seem interested in investing the money into like previous games. This also took away from being able to give your character their own identity.

You would need to add bonuses like increased fire rate when your shields are down or that enemy takes a % extra damage from your attacks while your shields are down. That being said, I don't see how this skill is \\\"skill\\\" based, it just forces you to focus an enemy that may not even be beneficial to focus if there are lots of enemies. Lots of the skill tree skills are skill based, even Gaige's anarchy tree required skill to manage the stacks and adjust to the rapidly decreasing accuracy. Ever fight BloodWing with like 200+ stacks? Have fun hitting that flying POS for the next (what will feel like an) hour.|||I am bad with ships so tell me how this works.Malevolence (Separatist, capital ship, General Grevious)**Basic:** Attack target enemy and have a 50% chance to call each droid ally to assist**Special 1: Reinforcements.** Give each ally the Droid Army buff for three turns. When this ally is destroyed it is immediately replaced based off of its type. Reinforcements called this way are immune to the buff*Attacker:* Vulture Droid *Tank:* HMP Droid Gunship *Support:* Tri-Droid**Special 2: Turbo Laser Barrage** Attack each enemy, Target Locked enemies can not avoid this. Each hit increases the damage when this ability is next used by 5%**Unique: Tactical Assault** When your last unit is destroyed the Malevolence sends out Grevious in his ship, Soulless One, accompanied by a Rogue class Starfighter. When this happens the capital ship can gain no turn meter until Grevious is defeated. Grevious and the Rogue class Starfighter are immune to the reinforcements buff. **Crew: Twin Ion Cannons (10 turn cooldown, starts on cooldown)** Instantly destroy all allied units, the capital ship gains 100% turn meter and then prioritize the Tactical Assault unique. Enemy units are stunned and reduced to 0 turn meter. If this stun is cleansed then inflict an undispelable ability block and buff immunity for two turns. The entire kit is built around making the fleet feel endless, obviously the stats of the new droids should be lower in terms of health and probably lacking protection. Unfortunately they gain no bonuses from target lock since droids don't really take risks and should be doing their best at all times. The basic attack starts out weak but picks up power as you go along, ideally you could manage to get 5 droid allies out and the basic would be pretty powerful, alternatively you could have it at 100% assist chance but you would have to make each attack do like 50% less damage. The first special I felt is critical to the CIS faction. They had billions of droids at their disposal, I tried to make it synergize with the rest of the kit too. The droids would have high accuracy and decent attack but would kind of be lackluster on their own. Vulture droids can multiattack and their special would be to call an assist. Droid gunship would be the only one to have protection, be slow, but could ability block on basic (a missile) or repair itself using a special. HMP gains taunt whenever an ally is killed. Tri droid does very weak attacks, is quick, and can inflict the buzzdroid debuff which can reduce speed by 5% per stack. |||Just a heads up, I could run this game at 30fps on a mid 2009 macbook pro, although lowest settings So a 2015 will be able to run it, may as well dive in since it is on sale right now on Steam +you can play with the community patch too You could always install Windows on a separate partition as well and see if it will run better|||Are you referring to human?|||To be fair Battleborn was trying hard to compete with Overwatch.

You'll probably want AMA since five headed dragon kinda sucks due to every deck having some way to weaken it.|||You're ridiculous if you think that their current model is manageable for buying cards. As someone who has spent money you could easily spend hundreds and end up with something not meta relevant or something that will be useless within a month. The worst part is that there is no resale, no matter how much you spend eventually one day this game will shut down and the (possibly 10s or hundreds) thousands you'd spend to keep up would be useless and have nothing to show for it Don't defend their shitty practices, it's not entitlement, it's not wanting to spend money for something that in reality has a value of $0 in the long run.|||My favorite is Elemental Hero Blazeman, the downside being that I haven't had much chance to use him as of late|||He said the remaster would be on Steam but they gave nothing for BL3 (unless I missed it during the stream).We can hope it comes to Steam though, it'll be a day one buy if it is.|||What rank are you? I'm currently in plat and using a wetlands deck. [Wetlands Deck](https://i.imgur.com/r76hWWN.jpg)The majn goal of this deck is to get Ooguchi out there since he only needs 2 attacks if you pair him with a star boy. Balance allows me to draw some backgrow most of the time. If anyone has any suggestions they'd be appreciated. I find Pathfinder too slow and too expensive too. This is a deck you want to finish your opponent with fast. I use Submarine frog to take out enemy beaters or walls and if I get 3 Star Boys I am set with crazy strong monsters. I was thinking of using that field protection spell but with such a tight deck I worry it will not be consistent enough.|||Yep, the line between team lead and associate isn't a thick one here|||Well yeah, the main thing is that the launcher isn't detecting the GPU.

It was actually very nice to see it pop up here though|||Right I just bought it and my favorite part of finishing work is going home and diving with my seamoth and being scared of every bump.

I'm going to ignore the whole invest responsibly comment as it's laughable since this is a gacha game.

Obviously designing encounters purely of CR won't work due to the number of PCs being able to act, so how do I go about balancing the challenge of monsters with such a large party?Thanks again, and keep up the awesome monster making!|||What are you wearing, a tablecloth?|||Man, that's relatable but also kind of sad.

If you didn't know of such a being already, you immediately gain the knowledge of such a legend as told by folklore and tales. The hero should be akin to an exemplary or superhuman example of the class and archetype that you have chosen.As a bonus action during combat, you can activate the power of this card to channel the mythological prowess and heroism that is represented by the aspect, which lasts for one minute. This power can not be suppressed, dispelled, or otherwise ended early once activated. On each round of combat, you gain an additional turn, which takes place at your initiative roll Â± 10 (your choice), losing initiative ties. During this time, you have advantage on all attack rolls and saving throws you make, and you gain temporary hit points equal to your character level at the start of each of your turns. You also gain immunity to the following conditions: charmed, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, stunned.After this effect ends, the power fades, and you gain immediate knowledge of an important part of the legend's heroics. This could be anything of grand importance to the hero, such as a quest that was left unfinished, or an impending doom that the hero would try to stop.|||Does this call for a PCMR picture thread?|||Where's the sub for the third option?|||Leave your mother out of this|||Straight Male. 8.5|||A funny way that my current group deals with breaking the fourth wall is that if they start talking too much out f character or start metagaming, then canonically, the character starts brain hemorrhaging, and we have to roleplay through it|||You're all kinds of wonderful.

Much, much better than that.I should know what I'm talking about. I myself commissioned a genuine katana in Japan for 2,400,000 Yen (that's about $20,000) and have been practicing with it for almost 2 years now. I can even cut slabs of solid steel with my katana.Japanese smiths spend years working on a single katana and fold it up to a million times to produce the finest blades known to mankind.Katanas are thrice as sharp as European swords and thrice as hard for that matter too. Anything a longsword can cut through, a katana can cut through better. I'm pretty sure a katana could easily bisect a knight wearing full plate with a simple vertical slash.Ever wonder why medieval Europe never bothered conquering Japan? That's right, they were too scared to fight the disciplined Samurai and their katanas of destruction. Even in World War II, American soldiers targeted the men with the katanas first because their killing power was feared and respected.So what am I saying? Katanas are simply the best sword that the world has ever seen, and thus, require better stats in the d20 system. Here is the stat block I propose for Katanas:(One-Handed Exotic Weapon)1d12 Damage19-20 x4 Crit+2 to hit and damageCounts as Masterwork(Two-Handed Exotic Weapon)2d10 Damage17-20 x4 Crit+5 to hit and damageCounts as MasterworkNow that seems a lot more representative of the cutting power of Katanas in real life, don't you think?tl;dr = Katanas need to do more damage in d20, see my new stat block.|||Well each time I open it I lower my expectations on what to eat, so :P|||Checkmate, ~~atheists~~ shitlords!|||You dirty console peasant.||| Ya damn rights, deadly rage dude.

I should clarify that the creature can communicate back with this feature while they're influenced this way. I need to rewrite this feature, as by RAW *friends* doesn't actually charm the target, but still gives you advantage on Charisma checks to interact with them.Your suggestion about Black Will is intriguing! I agree that it seems rather lackluster compared to, say, the UA Ancestral Guardian's 10th level ability where they can cast clairvoyance once per rest. That being said, none of the other barbarian paths offer a direct combat advantage for their 10th level abilities, and I'd like to model this path after the official material. It could be changed so that Black Will was more core to the subclass, but barbarians have on-demand advantage anyway. It's tricky, this one.And thanks for catching that with hellbreak!

If you didn't know of such a being already, you immediately gain the knowledge of such a legend as told by folklore and tales. The hero should be akin to an exemplary or superhuman example of the class and archetype that you have chosen.As a bonus action during combat, you can activate the power of this card to channel the mythological prowess and heroism that is represented by the aspect, which lasts for one minute. This power can not be suppressed, dispelled, or otherwise ended early once activated. On each round of combat, you gain an additional turn, which takes place at your initiative roll ± 10 (your choice), losing initiative ties. During this time, you have advantage on all attack rolls and saving throws you make, and you gain temporary hit points equal to your character level at the start of each of your turns. You also gain immunity to the following conditions: charmed, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, stunned.After this effect ends, the power fades, and you gain immediate knowledge of an important part of the legend's heroics. This could be anything of grand importance to the hero, such as a quest that was left unfinished, or an impending doom that the hero would try to stop.|||What the hell did I walk into|||Easy on the edge there, Nietzsche.|||Hey creepyPMs fight me irl|||Ecks.Fucking.Dee.|||People are retarded|||R O A S T E DOASTED|||A high level Bladesinger/Divination/Abjuration Wizard with mobility and wall spells, Meteor Swarm and Power Word spells.

The specifics would probably need play testing to really get right. I actually have a homebrew feat that tries to fit this bill, if you'd be interesting in considering it.&amp;#x200B;Well of Metamagic*Prerequisite: the ability to cast at least one 1st-level spell*You’ve learned to tap into the innate creation of magic, giving you the following benefits:You learn two of the Metamagic options available to the sorcerer. If you already have sorcery points, you gain 2 more; otherwise you have 2 sorcery points. Sorcery points are used to fuel the Metamagic options that augment the spells that you cast. You regain these 2 sorcery points when you complete a long rest.As a bonus action, you can convert 2 sorcery points to regain a spell slot of 1st level. Alternatively, you can use a bonus action to convert a 1st level spell slot into 2 sorcery points if you have none remaining. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you complete a long rest.You can choose to gain this feat again, gaining 2 additional sorcery points and learning one additional Metamagic option. You also gain the use of the third benefit an additional time before completing a long rest.&amp;#x200B;|||Deep, bro|||R A D I C A L|||Really the only difference being who gets mass roasted/shamed.

Whimsical and charming, he more or less did whatever he wanted at the time. That is, until he arrived at a continent that was horribly oppressive and racist. Part of his character growth was overthrowing the government after extended time with the townsfolk, finding out how better off his life was compared to theirs, and was deeply disturbed by how unfair it was. He's now the Chaotic Good Lord of the Dance of said continent. He's also a lot more focused and decisive when it concerns the well-being of others.|||Dead|||You have problems?

I should clarify that the creature can communicate back with this feature while they're influenced this way. I need to rewrite this feature, as by RAW *friends* doesn't actually charm the target, but still gives you advantage on Charisma checks to interact with them.Your suggestion about Black Will is intriguing! I agree that it seems rather lackluster compared to, say, the UA Ancestral Guardian's 10th level ability where they can cast clairvoyance once per rest. That being said, none of the other barbarian paths offer a direct combat advantage for their 10th level abilities, and I'd like to model this path after the official material. It could be changed so that Black Will was more core to the subclass, but barbarians have on-demand advantage anyway. It's tricky, this one.And thanks for catching that with hellbreak! I should've stated that the target gets a Wisdom saving throw to resist it.Once again, thank you for your time!|||Shh, keep 'em guessing|||People can die if you murder them|||D I C K S   O U T|||Me irl.

They're outfitted with jump jets that have a few spells stored on them and grappling hooks attached to their hips.

I took a look at the most recent versions and they're pretty wonky.Blood Hunter is a cool idea, and has some cool class features, but its language and execution is pretty wonky and creates plenty of weird interactions with spells, creature types (no targeting undead/constructs with blood curses, even if you're a Ghost Slayer pre-level 7). There's also certain features (the radiant rite damage comes to mind immediately, and some of the mutagen concoctions. I'm not looking at it right now so I can't pull up all of them) where some features are *clearly* better and some you wonder why they're there in the first place.Gunslinger is fine, I guess. But why not obviate the misfire and gain better on-hit effects options by going with a Battle Master fighter? I haven't incorporated firearms into my setting properly yet, so I keep it out mostly for thematic reasons.I've allowed every other UA subclass from Wizards except for Mystic and Lore Master Wizard, because they can get bonkers-broken if built right, more so than what one can do in the base game. There are cheesey builds, but these can be more like stinky cheese.I've also posted all of my homebrew subclasses and other content to a FB group with all the players I DM for and ask for feedback if they want to give it. One of my players is currently playing a homebrew Ranger conclave, which basically plays like an adaptation of the pilots from Titanfall and Attack on Titan and it seems to be going well for him.

Not disappointment, attention-whore, or edgy tween, but unemployable.|||Hey, let me just say that I am really digging the feel and mechanics of this subclass! I actually like it more than Mercer's Blood Hunter in how it seems to present itself as something that fits in with the rest of 5e and doesn't feature mechanics that have weird interactions with others. I'm going to list off all of the things that I've spotted that might give me pause or somehow sticks out in no particular order.* Sanguine spells: Most of these fit really well with the theme you have going on and pack some punch. However, might I suggest *hold monster* in place of *enervation*? This is partly to do with the \\\"i hunt monsters relentlessly\\\" shtick, and partly because I don't think enervation is a good spell ¯\\\\\\\\\\\\_(ツ)_/¯* The Channel Vitality's Infusion is cool and thematic, but it's an action and only does 1d4 extra damage until 11th level, even if you can make an attack with it you might be better off casting *hunter's mark* in most situations. Looking at the elemental damage, every elemental type on that list gets a nice boon from *elemental bane* except necrotic, which sticks out.* Channel Divinity: Malediction offers diminishing returns as you level up for lower level spells. At 13th level, why would you sacrifice 26 HP to cast *bane* when you can get *elemental bane* for the same HP cost? Maybe consider altering the hit points sacrificed to vary depending on the spell cast. As an aside, when it says \\\"You can't regain a use again until you finish a long rest.\\\" does this mean that once you sacrifice HP you're locked out until you long rest or can you use it without sacrificing HP after a short rest?* Desperate Struggle is a nice ability, but it seems like the temp HP you get should be based on spell level. Also, should the temporary hit points last until you long rest like most sources of temp HP?* Sacrifice Vitality: Lethal Infusion is a nice upgrade. I assume that the extra attacking benefit is only supposed to happen if you take your level's worth of necrotic damage and not twice your level's worth of necrotic damage from using Channel Vitality after expending its use?* Sacrifice Vitality: Maledict Terror's frighten seems to be at odds with *hold person*, *enervation* and partially *bestow curse*, having the fear effect either not really matter in the case of *hold person* and actually work against you in the case of *enervation*, as the target will be more inclined to leave its area of effect or seek cover from you.* Rite of Pain seems kinda nuts when used in conjunction with your other self-damaging abilities, seeing as how you can take as little as 1 damage from anything and target whatever's in range, on top of being at-will. Perhaps consider limiting its use to X/rest?* Edit: I know it's not mandatory for rangers, but I can't help but feel that there's something exploration or social interaction based that could gel really well in this class. Maybe like an X/rest feature that lets you identify whether or not a creature is poisoned/diseased/charmed/affected by magic.Despite the longish critique, I think you've got something really cool here, and I'd like to see where it goes!|||DM here.

I'm sick of all this \\\"Masterwork Bastard Sword\\\" bullshit that's going on in the d20 system right now. Katanas deserve much better than that. Much, much better than that.I should know what I'm talking about. I myself commissioned a genuine katana in Japan for 2,400,000 Yen (that's about $20,000) and have been practicing with it for almost 2 years now. I can even cut slabs of solid steel with my katana.Japanese smiths spend years working on a single katana and fold it up to a million times to produce the finest blades known to mankind.Katanas are thrice as sharp as European swords and thrice as hard for that matter too. Anything a longsword can cut through, a katana can cut through better. I'm pretty sure a katana could easily bisect a knight wearing full plate with a simple vertical slash.Ever wonder why medieval Europe never bothered conquering Japan? That's right, they were too scared to fight the disciplined Samurai and their katanas of destruction. Even in World War II, American soldiers targeted the men with the katanas first because their killing power was feared and respected.So what am I saying? Katanas are simply the best sword that the world has ever seen, and thus, require better stats in the d20 system. Here is the stat block I propose for Katanas:(One-Handed Exotic Weapon)1d12 Damage19-20 x4 Crit+2 to hit and damageCounts as Masterwork(Two-Handed Exotic Weapon)2d10 Damage17-20 x4 Crit+5 to hit and damageCounts as MasterworkNow that seems a lot more representative of the cutting power of Katanas in real life, don't you think?tl;dr = Katanas need to do more damage in d20, see my new stat block.|||D I S A V O WISAVOW|||Lmao sometimes I try to subtly provoke people into a fight with me so that they can hit me haha and these people are usually my friends haha fuck|||More accurate imo|||We should make like me_irl typically does and run it into the ground|||Don't fuck up bro|||Ring|||Sup mellow Mike?|||Quality rekking right there|||A funny way that my current group deals with breaking the fourth wall is that if they start talking too much out f character or start metagaming, then canonically, the character starts brain hemorrhaging, and we have to roleplay through it|||R O A S T E   D|||ISFP. 3deep|||Hey, thanks for the kind words!I do intend to play test this once I get enough free time on my hands to get together with my gaming group.

It suggests that meat *could* have been involved with numerous other factors. It is a theory, not a fact. And frankly, if it were true, I would have no problem with that at all. It does not suggest in the slightest that anyone should eat meat or that eating meat makes you intelligent (not saying you think so) or that it is somehow \\\"logical\\\" to eat it because of the evolution of our intestines, and stuff, possibly maybe, as was suggested by SenselessNoise, because you know, survival of the fittest makes sense in there for no reason (I am not sure whether that was a joke or not by him/her to be honest).    So meat is nutrient dense because lions exist, dude.. (no offense, but seriously, this is getting out of hand)  Did you do a search on meat on PLOS as well? Please do.

Everyone hits a certain point of being pragmatic about whatever they believe in. The point I was trying to make, is that life should be impossible to relate to any sorts of economics, property or number. If you understand that, then your perception on how to treat life probably changes, which I think is a good thing. Why? Because human beings are always trying to find ways to rationalize their behavior, and that can lead to terrible consequences.  It all comes back to what kind of person you want to be; the one that tries to treat all life with equal respect, or the one that categorizes life with less-to-more-value.  Your friend is a perfect example of trying to rationalize life in a less-to-more-value. She says that her dog is innocent and thus have greater value. Look at how consistent she is what that logic. If her dog is innocent, then she can not eat animals, because they are all innocent life, she can not feed her dog with innocent life, and so forth.  People are generally not rational or logical, but they do rationalize their behavior. Every murder comes with some kind of rationality behind it. War?!  Would she do the same thing and push her boyfriend? Her father or mother? Do you think she would respond differently, if she valued both you and her dog equally and perhaps looked for a way to save both your lives, instead of having the built-in sense, that her dog must live at the cost of your life; because, you know, she likes her dog and stuff, and that makes it OK? ;)|||Secretkeeper is a Samba dancerThankfully Samba is rarely seen in the world, the days of reducing women to sex symbols is at an end!|||I do not have photographic memory as you do, but what you say seems normal as an TYPE_MENTION.

Nekroz is a combo deck and inherently more skillful than a deck like spellbooks. Nekroz are similar to mermails in skill level, maybe a bit less though.

Kissing in your base can be the opposite. (Everything ahead is dependent on map position) Generally, kissing as flagpro is good, and kissing a flagpro is bad. Kissing a JJ is good and Kissing with jj is bad. Kissing with a RB is really good and Kissing a Rb is borderline retarded if you did it intentionallyJust make sure you stay ahead and you play in the boost lanes. You have to stay close enough where he cant boost around you. Generally, don't push out on him if its a 2v2 at their flag because if you get juked, your teammate gets blocked 2v1.

Also having a good team (not firing shots)I havent seen much but you seem to be above the level of most people with your experience. If you follow any other games with a competitive scene you'll notice they have a meta game. A wise player name i have forgotten once told me that MLTP, mLTP, and NLTP have different juke and playstyle metas, that an NLTP player could juke an MLTP player because the jukes an NLTP player can execute at his level, aren't what an MLTP player would expect, and that it would work a few times. That could be horse shit tho. Also i'd think in an MLTP vs nLTP game, the MLTP people would try less if that makes sense.

It's usually pretty clear from the start who the A-Team guys are. Usually 4 get to play the entire match unless they have technical difficulties, need a sub, or the captain feels like they are not playing as well another starter player. The captain makes all decisions on this stuff, and he'll schedule stuff, and tell you who is playing A-team through modmail. B-Team is the catch all league where the players that aren't A-team go. This can still be extremely competitive, and have great players, they just aren't the ones the captain played for A-team that week. If you show up to a B-team game, you get time, and usually the time is spread out pretty evenly between all B-team players. A-team players can play B-team if they don't get all their A-team minutes in, and B-team guys can sub in for A-team guys if they're having problems too.|||cant tell if ur srs|||I should be on the mod team.There was a time when i easily could have. :).

The letters are like a pattern to describe the functions each type has. Functions are the way we perceive information, and each type has ones they use the most. For example, a person with extroverted thinking as there most dominant function(TYPE_MENTION, TYPE_MENTION) would mainly process external information first, and they would amalyze and try to understand all its aspects. There are 8 functions, external and internally perceiving versions of Feeling, Thinking, Sensing, and Intuition, and each person has 4, in decesding order from most to least dominant.The first letter shows if your most dominant function is introverted or extroverted. Functions stutterstep, if you have a introverted dominant function, your secondary will be extroverted and vice versaThe second letter, if you have a P at the end, is the function of your most dominant extroverted function. If you have a J at the end, its your most dominant introverted functionThe third letter, if you have a P at the end is your most dominant introverted function, and if you're a J its the opposite.The forth letter modifies the middle 2. Any good test will test you based on functions instead of each individual letter in the acronym, but there are very little tests like that. Testing by each letter in the acronym is super stupid and unreliable, and a lot people think its all in the acronym.There is logic behind MBTI, and its meant to be able to map out your general tendencies based on your functions, it's not meant to say exactly what you are or do. Most tests have accuracy problems. The first test here, id say is about 50% accurate, while the 25quiz one is about 75%, its downfall being reader preference, people answer hat sounds better, for example, everyone loves being an introvert for some reason lol, so they answer towards that.Anyways, its ok if you disagree, im just tryng to defend it and point out that bad logic that article had(and a lot of the mbti community has)|||I agree|||What do you call a ghoultree that lives in mountains?A gruultree|||I piloted a basic midrange hunter deck to rank 14 before, you have the tools, and its a deck easily improved upon.

A defender has to communicate which lane the fc should take and which way he should predict to boost (top or bottom) to get around the one defender. They wont be able to pass the idea fast enough 100% of the time. Thats just a small scenario with very limited factors too. Theres a kindof luck involved in tagpro in where the other team is, so id say that in itself makes a perfect game impossible.Thats covering flag carrying, which will happen when a defense would go into a lose-lose situation with a perfect offense and any kindof map element that helps you grab.jukings another story, same result though. To juke, you have to predict what the other person is gonna do, and to do the opposite of what they are thinking. Except the perfect defense should predict that, and the perfect offense should counterplay their predicting, and the perfect defense has to counter that. In a matchup of the perfect offense and the perfect defense, someone loses and its not a perfect game anymore.|||Messi|||Loaded Mac and cheese with bacon|||I uses to play Yugioh like 2-3 years ago.

It really sucks. I've spent hours and hours thinking over really depressing things and it sucks. My depression and any depression I will have is from thinking and feeling like life is pointless.But life is everything. Everything. Including everything youve ever known about anything, and your ability to know and feel. Sadness is just a tint covering a rainbow, obscuring some of the colors, so you see it differently.Just because you got destroyed by Face Hunter for like the 4th time in a row today, and your Deck that you spent hours on just isn't working like all the websites said it should, and MC tech seems to always take the very creature you needed most, and you might have just totally forgot he had lethal and spent your mana before realizing that you should've played sludge belcher. All these things don't make Hearthstone an unenjoyable game, you're just having a bad day or bad streak. They say on the climb to legend, if you have like a 60% win rate, you still have those times where you drop like 3 ranks that it took you like 7 hours to rise through. But as they say RNG evens out over time, and you're suddenly back on track to get your legend card back, on like a 4 game winning streak too!Just because you lost 7 tagpro games in a row doesn't mean you're terrible or that the game is awful, nobody garunteed amazing luck or an amazing team. Some balls get on everyones team, and people lose because of that. Some days you go 15-2 for the day and feel amazing, and can't help but smile and laugh at everything, and other days 2-15 and backseat driving everyone on your team while feeling like you're gonna cry. But the majority of the time you sit towards the middle around your average win%. And just like TagPro, and Hearthstone, a mindset can make or break your win%. What I'm saying is, take the bad with the good, RNG stabilizes, life isn't that bad all the time, just remember all the good times and average ones when you're feeling depressed. I never wanted to die, I just wanted to feel better. And BTW, I just want you to know I'm probably one of my best friends, real life and TagPro. You're the freaking best. I've never been able to really befriend someone online well until i met you.|||i know :(|||I'm not allowed to say the things i said during that game here but I was screaming|||Bruh.

This thread just gave me a new one haha.Probably my most favorite songs over the years below. I used to be super into grunge, emo, punk rock, but i've gotten into rap haha. I really like message, and I really like flow. There are a few exceptions though. I went through my library and picked out a lot of songs, and came to the conclusion that y'all probably wouldn't listen to all of them. So in the case that anybody does, I'll pick what are the \\\"best ones\\\" [3005 - Childish Gambino](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG35R8F2j8k) This is my favorite song. It was a pretty big hit, with a lot under the surface. The lyrics are very existential, and helps me find comfort being insignificant, being able to go from unthinking and happy about the world down to shit I don't like talking about. You really have to sit down and think about what he says, and how depressing it is to understand where Gambino is coming from. Also, youtube comments have no idea what they are talking about.~~[Rap genius link](http://genius.com/Childish-gambino-v-3005-lyrics)~~ Actually looking at it its a lot of filler of stupid conspiracies lol. [All you can do - George Watsky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urma71sQXpY)Watsky raps about his carelessness and trys to message it to the listener. The whole second verse it about when he was at warped tour, he nearly joined the 27 club (a group of musicians that died at 27) because he tried to [stage dive into the crowd from a fucking light rig](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc4pITXwL7A) (lol) He ended up going to the hospital but severely hurt the girl he landed on, and broke another guys arm. It's a great song, Watsky is my idol haha. Except for the stage dive lol.[Never let it die - George Watsky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSaA8PnPM44)Watsky raps some general encouragement and the meaning of life. His lyrics say it all. My favorite quote from music is here. \\\"So if you've got a flame thats blazing hot within take a deep breath and feed it oxygen\\\" Theres also a bonus poem at the end about the Holocaust that isnt in this video for some reason. It's really moving.[Basket Case - Green Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUTGr5t3MoY) This probably is me in a nutshell. Each song i tell myself is my favorite for a different reason. Well the reason for this one is it describes how I feel a lot of the time. I despise myself sometimes and go a little crazy trying to comprehend it. Maybe i'm reading too much into the song? I really like it anyways. It's catchy.[4 A.M. Monday - Watsky]Watsky turned down 250K to do a t-mobile ad when he was still a broke college student because he thought he was better than that and he wants it to be all him, not some company filtering his shit. Says a lot about his charecter[Moral of the story - George Watsky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M1L15hpphQ)Watsky raps about his determination to become something and the moral of his story and what it takes. Too bad I don't listen :([Hey Asshole - George Watsky(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXTxoPFmL0k)I've gotten tired of writing things for every song. I promise these songs are amazing. Watsky is bae.

      "  \"posts\": \"Thank you very much for the support. I am working on my actions on a daily basis and hope that I am doing well at it. The way I was able to develop these skills was after taking mushrooms while in Vegas for my friends birthday. The mushrooms we took were called Psilocybe cubensis. I don't recommend taking them, because we don't need it, but I won't deny that it allowed me to understand how things worked. As much as I wish to experience that night again, I won't. All of this must be achieved naturally. That is the ultimate goal.Throughout that night we had I experienced so much that it took me a while to regroup my thoughts. That is the night that I met my guardian angel. The effects after that night lasted for two weeks or so. My girlfriend and I felt extremely sensitive to our surroundings. She was constantly seeing auras around us. I was starting to have visions, seeing auras, and that voice that I heard that night was there for me everyday after that. I started to do research, find communities, and work on those skills I experienced. I wanted to achieve the same results without digesting mushrooms.What I've learned from that night and these past few months is that our angels speak to us using our voice. They also use radio frequencies, numbers, or objects to catch our attention. Are you familiar with that inner dialog voice that you have in your head, the one that you feel coming from your forehead, telling you to do right over wrong? That is your angel. That is the voice that will give you guidance. Listen to it and follow it. You will notice positive things will begin to manifest if you so do. You can also challenge it by doing the opposite. I don't recommend doing so, because you will most likely be proven wrong, but this is something that you must learn and go through to understand. I'm stubborn to the point of consistent challenges, but eventually surrendered myself and finally accepted it for what it is. I don't question that voice anymore, and if I do, it's because I am still learning to let go.For energy, there are some videos online that will help you train. [This](https://youtu.be/1617z8K7lTo) video helped me. Energy looks smokey and radiates just like light. You will notice colored outlines in that energy as well. Take your time and see if you can begin to notice it. You can practice on anything. This all takes time. Do your best to stay consistent, immerse yourself, and not give up. If I can be of help let me know.|||Here are my answers:1) I chose to eat Fish because of esoteric beliefs, which are for my personal health and protection of others. To explain myself, I am told by my guardian angel (This is the esoteric part) that we should not eat animals and we should protect them. I asked about Fish and I was told that it's okay as it was designed for us. I'm constantly reassured about this.2) The intellect level of Fish and the alike compared to others is definitely on a different scale, but it's not an indication that they suffer less. Each of us have the ability to suffer. We tolerate and endure it differently.3) I don't plan to go Vegan or Vegetarian. I've tried both diets and after my experiences and research, I know that eating Fish is the right choice.I'd like to explain myself further to hopefully bring some insight as to why I eat Fish. I understand that we should not cause harm to one another, Fish suffer when we hunt them, but I also understand that this is the cycle of life. An example to this life cycle could be Bee's. We understand the importance of their existence, but we also know that Birds eat Bee's. Where does that put the Bird? Does that make them malicious, or do we/they acknowledge that this is their natural prey and it's okay? Same goes for Cats that eat Birds, or Coyotes who eat Cats. The same applies for us when it comes to eating Fish.Now there are other solutions available now in days to substitute meats and fish to obtain the lack of nutrients available, but I prefer to eat what was created and designed for us and not an imitation product. Let's take Gardein for example:Golden Fishless Filet Ingredients: water, soy protein concentrate, expeller pressed canola oil*, potato starch, modified vegetable gum, soy protein isolate*, vital wheat gluten*, sea salt, natural flavors (from plant sources), yeast extract, organic cane sugar, citric acid, algal oil (plant source of omega 3 DHA and EPA), onion powder, pea protein, carrot fiber, color added, paprika, rosemary and turmeric extracts. breading: wheat flour*, modified corn starch, tapioca starch, yellow corn flour, onion powder, salt, garlic powder, wheat gluten*, baking powder, canola oil, soy flour, spices, sugar, paprika, citric acid, turmeric, xanthan gum.*Non genetically engineered soybeans, wheat and canola.It just seems a bit much, don't you think?Also, not all sea beings are okay to feast upon. Squid, Lobster, or Dolphins for instance I avoid and should be avoided. Salmon, Albacore, Tuna, Sardines, et cetera are okay to eat. It is difficult to comprehend what is right and what is not to eat, but that's okay because we got plenty of time to understand and it's up to each and one of us to figure that out. This is what I've learned so far and it's what I'm trying to stick to.|||You're welcome and thank you for replying. I will message you so we can converse.|||It is our life and we can do whatever we want. The freedom of it is the best part of our existence. I can tell you though that I know it's instinctively wrong. If it wasn't, we'd be dead by now and it wouldn't be such a struggle doing so with the knowledge we have. So many choices readily available, but we're always giving ourselves another chance.Speaking freely, the reason why we struggle so much with it is because we have better things to do, whether it's conscious or not. It's up to us to find out what those are and it becomes part of our journey. We have the great quality of being born natural explorers and survivors; designed to endure the wilderness. Ask yourself, if you were to be placed in a pool for the first time, would you make an attempt to swim, or would you allow yourself to sink? To sink without an attempt for survival would simply indicate that we have made that choice, and that choice comes from the mind. It's not something that our hearts would do.With that being said, how does your mind feel if your heart had to be turned off? How would your heart feel if your mind had to be turned off? Also, how often do we try to shut our mind vs our heart? I hope you see where I am going with this, and I hope that whatever choices we make remain wise and are for the best.|||I know you didn't say that I lied, but you're stating that I am making this up and being aggressive with your words. Just by reading your history and your comments on this post, I can tell that you are not the finest to converse with, so can we put anything that is negative to the side for now and take this opportunity to either learn from one another?As for your questions, here are my answers. I don't think I am a leader and never really been one. I tend to let others lead because I wish for them to pursue their desires. I'm there for encouragement and support. I never planned on being a leader, but I know I've been a warrior. The leadership is God's will because sees and wants it in me, and my angel has been assigned to guide me to become one. I kindly accepted the opportunity and doing my best to be one, and it just seems at this point that it's something that I cannot escape from. This doesn't necessarily mean that I am one now or even for that matter will become one, because I have much to grow, but I am being trained and taking the necessary steps to be one. I'm sure that both of us can agree that one cannot simply be a leader of light overnight, especially in heaven. There are so many laws that must be obeyed and followed, and it requires much discipline.As it is now, it's hard enough to be an example to the world. To redefine my history, to be something completely different than what I've grown to be and wished for, and performed several lifestyle changes for everyone, including yourself. I've sacrificed, I've learned to accept suffering, and experienced much that will help me define my roll. As days go by, I find myself slowly strengthening my core. One that cannot be broken down. But, I do worry that if I were to lead that I could fail and disappoint, but that is part of growth. We all fall and rise, and that is what I am doing now. I wish for peace and justice in this universe. We all deserve it and I will do whatever it takes to accomplish it, because I know I can. It's apparent that I've been in search for this greatness since a child, and I found it.There is also a sense of honor with this roll, and I believe that is enough for me. I'm also not The One to lead, but one of many to do so. There are many out there with the same path as mine, and I am here to find them so we can unite. Being in this together is what brings me satisfaction.|||They do encompass melancholy well. [Day](https://youtu.be/w9jEmJww2dQ) is one of my favorites. I can listen to this song at any given time on repeat.|||Exactly, and admirable perspective I must say. People have questions and we need to help every way possible. Sleep paralysis or spirit, it's my responsibility to share my knowledge with others in need of help.|||The world needs more kindness because we give up too easily on it. How can we be kindhearted when we focus on hatred? It's not an easy task, but it can be. It's up to us to choose what kind of man we wish to be. As one friend once told me, \\\"It's easier to frown than to smile\\\".I grew up not having many friends and always had this urge of having more. In my twenties I established many friendships. I was content knowing that I could converse amongst so many, but soon found myself overwhelmed that I couldn't keep up with all of them. Those friends drifted as time went by. Dozens of friends I may not have, and I don't expect to have many either, but I have enough to know that I will never miss an important moment in their life. Try not to isolate yourself either from the ones you love and those who love you.Relationships are wonderful, but they are also difficult. I believe this is where your ache comes from. After my last relationship I've learned to develop myself in the interim and wait for the right one. I may never meet my soulmate, so I've accepted the possibility that my journey will be rather independent. Until then it's not of importance, but I understand and know that I have to make better choices in the future if I wish to find that person. Love is one of a kind and we must be aware of who we share it with. Not limiting it because of fear and doing so scarcely, but to ensure that our inner-self maintains integrity during the process and our hearts remain intact.It's not of my intention to minimize your emotions and words, but I do this because it's what I do to help bring a silver lining. We both know you're not content, so why deny yourself the love and time for a happier you? What's the rush with letting go when you know you haven't done so yet after all these years? I'm sure you know the grass is greener on the other side, so allow yourself the time to nurture your side of the plain while you're on it. Strive to be one who remains kind when dirt gets thrown in your face, one who's abused and taken advantage of without a care, one who finds the perfect love and loves unconditionally, one with the might of a mountain and never gives up, and most importantly being one with yourself. If that day hasn't come yet, then today is that day. Today is your day to rise and shine and if it isn't, then ask yourself how long do you have to wait before sacking up and doing it.|||Hello, Skillcode. I'd like to apologize for being rude to you earlier this week. It was uncalled for and I shouldn't be judging you in such manner. I've put a lot of thought into what you've said, along with these past few months. I can be stubborn and prideful at times, but I also know that it's not my ego. All I can do now is continue marching forward in hopes of meeting those who wish to unite and inspire those I meet. Take care and wish you the best.|||It doesn't make a difference to those who don't wish to know, but it's made a difference for me, because it matters to me.|||Of course. I have no reason to lie. If it wasn't true I wouldn't be who I am now and I wouldn't be here in the first place. I'm approaching everyone with honesty to establish trust because I'm here asking for help. You are more than welcome to question it and you are not obligated to believe in it.|||Since a child I've been able to see and feel spirits so I've always believed and still do. I would share my thoughts with my family and friends, and they would always deny or question what I was sharing. In recent times my immediate family members now wonder what I experience and ask several questions to understand.I've had multiple experiences, but my first paranormal experience involving others with validity began about thirteen years ago when I decided to buy a Ouija board. My girlfriend at the time and I got setup in my bedroom and started asking questions. I cannot remember the questions, but the first three responses we received were 6-6-6, and then the planchette would proceed to be moved off the board. We would look at each other and got into the typical back and forth \\\"You're moving it!\\\".After realizing what was happening, I had to put this to the test. My grandpa had died that year and I asked if they knew him. The planchette moved to yes. I then started speaking in spanish, because my girlfriend didn't speak that language. The planchette then spoke to me in spanish. I remember it saying \\\"Hola\\\" and a few other questions involving how I was. I was so intrigued and fascinated, yet in surprise with I was seeing and reading. We stopped playing for the night as I had to regroup my thoughts about what we were experiencing.During the next three months I was starting to see a spirit in my room. They had a white complexion and a long dress. It had a blue and white aura. Their facial features I couldn't see, but I could see the shape of their body and it resembled one of a woman. This spirit I saw often and it was very harmless. I really wasn't scared of her, more concerned as to why she was there and what she wanted.One night while trying to sleep I felt something grab my forearm. I opened my eyes to look and saw a masculine hand grabbing me, and I could see their arm up to their biceps. The arm was dressed in a suit and the hand was rather big and masculine. I immediately flew out of bed to turn on the lights. I looked around and saw nothing. I couldn't sleep for another hour or so because I was terrified. I didn't feel or have visions of them after that night.Some of my friends were aware of me playing Ouija, but they didn't know what I was dealing with. I started to tell one friend in particular of my visions because I knew he would understand. He was into paranormal as well as I was. One day I invited him over so we can play video games and he stood still in the hallway as we walked towards my bedroom. He called my name loudly and asked me to check out a picture that was hanging. The picture was of my great grandpa and great grandma. They were standing next to one another. He said: \\\"Aren't these the people you are seeing?\\\". The visions I had fit exactly with that image. It didn't occur to me until then that maybe I was talking to them and not the grandpa that I knew as a child.I don't have the original picture of my great grandpa and great grandma together, but below are links to their portraits. I believe these pictures were cropped out of the original that we have with the family:[Ana](http://www.geni.com/people/Ana-Ibarra/6000000018233883842)[Christian](http://www.geni.com/people/Christian-Br%C3%BCgmann-Schr%C3%B6der/6000000018234050072)I played the Ouija board a few times after that, but it wasn't the same. I avoided playing home anymore and started playing in remote locations with my paranormal friend. It wouldn't move as it did that night, or even respond for that matter. The board I had kept for memory sake, but destroyed it about a year and a half ago. Haven't really played with one since, but been curious to use one again.|||That was kind of you to say and you're very welcome.|||My friend said the same thing when I told him about it. Out of all the names angels have, Mike. I didn't really know what to say either because that is how it's been told to me and I've asked so many times for reassurance. But I agree, I am you, you are me. We are the same and I don't think any differently of ourselves than others.|||Hello! I feel like you are a female version of myself, so I hope that I can provide some guidance. Whatever you do, don't change who you are. If you resonate well with black, then wear it. If you enjoy solitude, spend time in it. If the tremolo picking and the vastness of darkness feeds your soul, listen to it, but my only advice is to not be it within your core. I myself grew up listening to Death/Black/Doom and I still do. I just choose my bands now and avoid satanism along with occultism. I just don't support that anymore. I even have a tattoo of a goat with big horns on my arm because of my favorite style of metal, which is Black. I just can't get enough of it. Even today I went to Amoeba and bought Katatonia and Ulver CDs, and listened to Hypothermia on the train ride because it rained here in LA. Nothing more perfect to me than gloomy weather, good music, and a cup of black coffee!Something that we have to embrace though is that even though we are kind hearted, not everyone will find us appealing, but that's okay. We don't find people fascinating ourselves either, until we find those who are alike. Black is quite enigmatic and I feel elegant wearing it. I love colors, but I can't resonate with it. My entire closet and house are in cold colors and shades. It's just who I am, and I find those who wear black are extremely appealing to me. Darkness is also just beautiful and not everyone will understand it. Whatever you do though always try to stay in the positive side of things. Stay true to who you are. People will respect that and it's better than being something we are not. Plus, those who keep you at a distance by your looks and interests are better off being away. We don't need judgemental people in our lives. We just need good hearted people and we know that they won't do such things to us. Socialize though, because it's healthy for us. Too much solitude can become a burden. You will eventually find the right people and stay strong hearted during the process. It takes time to establish solid friendships and people come and go quickly.I feel like I have a lot to say, but I hope that I was able to convey my message. Feel free to message me or reply to my post. Perhaps there's something in your mind that you'd like to share.|||Thank you for replying. I believe that I am a leader because this is what is being presented to me, what other have seen, and not because I think I am. I know exactly who I am. It's also not a matter of stepping into light because I'm already in it, but a matter of experiencing and sharing common interests. The beauty of this journey is that I know I have plenty of time to develop myself and I choose to go all the way. I know I am young this is why I am seeking others to converse with, but I don't need them as all the information I need is within me.I speak of God as it was presented to me by Archangel Michael. He said that it's okay for me to call him Mike or Michael. After reading your comment, he informed me that your perception of me is inaccurate, but you do have a point of suggesting letting go of darkness as I no longer need it, but it's difficult because I've learned to appreciate it. It's part of who I am. I tried to let go of it previously and failed. He understands it's a matter of time, which he wishes would be sooner than later, but I will continue to work on it.I live in a city that doesn't have much to offer. I will be making a point to travel further to find local communities that I can participate in. For the names you mentioned I've never heard of them so will look into those sometime this week. I appreciate sharing them with me and again, thank you for your words.|||I was baptised Mormon when I was eight and went to church for a few years until I was a teen. I'm familiar with some religions as I've been invited by friends and family to share their beliefs, and researched throughout the course of time for personal knowledge. I never felt right being part of a religion as the teachings did not match with the fundamentals, which is love.I am not familiar with most spiritual teachers, but way I see Buddha, or for instance the Pope, is that that they are good examples of what is good and that we are all human doing the best we can, but personally feel that we praise and focus too much on what they did/do rather than what we are doing.I won't get offended if you shared your beliefs with me, because I am here to learn from your personal experience and hope you can learn from mine, and what I've gained from these beings is that we must love, do the best we can, and be an example to others. I personally don't follow them as I follow my spiritual teacher (archangel) for guidance. The advice I get is more direct and personal with my current circumstances.|||Hello and thank you for taking the time reading my post and replying. That's really awesome that you wanted to be a sorcerer because I've felt the same way when I was young. I've always wanted to be a Black Magic Wizard, like the Black Mage from Final Fantasy. Cast Fire, Lightning, and summon Death upon everything. I believe that is unnecessary.If you have time, please read whatever you desire from [this](http://www.shamanicjourney.com/demons) page about Shamanism and Demons. Everything this article talks about is very accurate to my findings and experiences. If you believe I should be a Shaman, then perhaps you are right. I normally gain knowledge from each teaching and use it to my advantage to figure things out on my own, and I have found Shamanism to be very similar to other traditions. I do have plenty of books here to read, so thanks again for the suggestion.I've always wondered if I've had issues. I still do at times. Perhaps like you said dealing with trauma, but I know I shouldn't discourage myself by minimizing my lifetime circumstances that have lead me to be who I am. Over the course of time I have dealt with a lot of spirits. Some are friendly, some are playful, while some are not. When I found out my girlfriend had a demon attached to her I was saddened, and then I was infuriated. Indeed, I am taking this very personal, but at the same time I'm following on the steps that have been paved for me. For protection, not retaliation. This is my spiritual journey and I'm really sorry that all this seems like an elaborate scheme. I mean, it's out there, but I believe we all know that the impossible can be possible. I've lived thirty years and then all of a sudden this comes up. What would you do? What if you had an angel come up to you, take you on a trip to go visit God, and then says: \\\"In order to fight evil, you must know evil\\\". Proceeds to explain the purpose of your life, let's you know how we can communicate with one another, and begins to talk about your past, present, future, and of others? Every word is manifested, says that you must protect everyone, that you must take care of the planet, and here's your road map. Call me Mike if you ever need me! How would you feel explaining all this to your family, friends, loved ones, and strangers? I'd really like to hear your sincere opinion, and for that matter anyone's.I'd like to quote as well the last sentence of this article: *And donâ€™t worry too much about this whole demon thing: if your heart is pure, they wonâ€™t bother you any.*This stands true to myself and this is the best advice I can give to anyone. This is the reason why I wish to help, because I know there are those who might need me, and I am here for them. Regardless what we will become, I truly believe that we should be supporting one another while we're here. Some are healers, some are fighters, and there are those like me.|||Thank you for your words. They're encouraging.|||Thank you very much. Lots of great jewelry being displayed and good friendly advice. Feels right to be here.|||DBridge is the shit and I love these mixes. I hope another one is released soon. Good taste by the way.|||I love everything and everyone, so no matter what my state of loving will always be the same, but what differentiates the love I've experienced with my partners is the ardor for one another, so indeed each partner felt different. The more love poured into my heart the more I returned, which allowed to create a never ending cycle of joy for both of us. I can tell you that out of the partners I've had I've only been able to achieve bliss with one of them.We all have our own ways of loving and as simple as love can be, it is rather complex at times and unique to each of us. The answer to who you love will lie within you, but I don't doubt that you've been in love twice.|||Yeah, those spirits are not fond to deal with and they will come back depending on circumstances. It's best to not fear or surrender to them. Easier said than done, but it will help you in the long run with any malicious encounter. The ultimate answer is to constantly resonate and radiate light from within.These spirits like to camouflage in the darkness of the night and attack us while we are in a weak and unconscious state of being. Use incense/sage/smoke to help keep them away. Meditation helps with awareness and the more aware you are of your surroundings, the more proactive you can be to prevent them from sneaking up on you, but even if you catch them before hand they will realize it and rapidly attack you as well. Also remember that no matter how strong or smart they are, light/love will always prevail. Look up Nightmare Demon for more information.What I said may go over your head and you will question it. You have every right to do so, but it's up to you to choose what you wish to believe in and whether you wish to accept your experience to be valid or not. But I will say this, if we had to agree on something it would be the fact that seeing and feeling that dark mass near you is not pleasant or welcoming at all, is it?|||A tip for growth that may help you in the right direction. Listen to that voice in your head. It's the voice of truth and will ultimately lead you to greatness. Try to not disregard it and follow it.To share my experiences and knowledge. The pineal gland is located in our forehead. This is how spirits communicate with us (Telepathy). That voice in our head is not coming from the back, but the front of it, right? Also, we think that we are talking to ourselves, but we are not. It's spirits using our voice and language to communicate with us as how we understand language.Spirits know everything about us and we all have one looking out for us. This spirit obviously knows that it's the depression talking and it's trying to provide you guidance. They want the best for us, so why deny ourselves from it?|||Then let's put our conversation to a rest for now. Thanks for your input and wish you well in your journey.|||You're fine so no need to be concerned as I won't think of you poorly. I briefly read your comment on my cell phone as I left work earlier today and it really got me thinking about where I stand now. I'm constantly being tested, and I constantly fail because it's not easy, but I have also succeeded in different areas.My loyalty still requires work because there are desires that I have that I cannot get rid of, which cause a conflict of interest. For instance, my music. Since a teenager I have been fascinated with a style of music called Black Metal. This music is based on satanism. How can I be an example to others when I listen support this music, while stating I value God? I'm a hypocrite. Back in February I boxed all my belongings and stored them away. Three weeks went by and all I wanted to do is go back. I missed it. I won't deny that I felt extremely well staying away from it, but I do acknowledge that this is holding me back with my progress. After tonight I decided I am going to sell all my merchandise and distance myself from it. I've been on this on my own, keeping things to myself, and after this post I realized that if I were to do this as it's been intended, I must be stronger. I am assuming that great things will happen to me, but I am also working towards them. It's up to me how far I wish to go. But I can tell you that I am loyal to my family, my friends, my past relationships, life, and my job. I don't give up easily and try to maintain integrity with what I do because I respect everyone.Leadership skills is a difficult one for me because I want to do what others want and desire, but I have no problems taking control over a situation when needed. I've been informed several times that I have great leadership skills. I am patient, supportive, team oriented, provide guidance, and tend to focus on what is best for everyone. My manager actually wants to put me in some sort of leadership position with the company that acquired us recently. I can say that I have no problem leading if I am confident, and this is all circumstantial depending what we as a group are dealing with. I've also had readings before by other clairvoyants and had told me that I am riding a silver horse and leading everyone to victory. I didn't know what that meant until later.Bravery I have been tested multiple times. I can't seem to fear and I have put thought into what would cause me to fear. Of course this has changed with the course of time. There were things that scared me, like death, but now feel comfortable dying. I don't want to yet, but if I had to I'm totally okay with it. I guess my biggest bravery challenge was trying to get rid of the demon that was attached to my girlfriend. To give you some insight, I started dating a girl about two years ago. I had her move into my apartment and after she had moved in I slowly began to feel a negative energy following her. One night I noticed a short black mass of energy following her into our bedroom. I went to my side of the bed and she went to use the restroom. I could feel that energy in the corner of the room and see it. Next thing I know I feel pressure around my neck. I couldn't really move and felt as I was being choked. I knew that it was attacking me, so I sat still and resisted, letting it know that I won't give up. After about what seemed like an eternity, it let go and I was able to move. I didn't feel it in my bedroom anymore once it let go. I didn't mention anything to my girlfriend until later.Months had gone by and things started getting really strange. I would smell sulfur coming from my bedroom, my cats would sit there paralyzed starring at my girlfriend - sometimes pee on her -, cabinet doors opening, objects moving, and I would wake up with scratches on my back. I researched all this and it's all related to demonic activity. I was furious and started to provoke it. I wanted it to leave her alone, but it was getting worse. I started to explain to my girlfriend what I was dealing with, and she was very skeptical over spirits, but she then started believing me to the point that she opened up to me. She one night told me that she had sold her soul to the devil when she was a teenager. She had performed some ritual with her friends and cut her wrists to pour blood into a cup. She showed me the cut and it was a small scar that was left. I am not sure what kind of ritual it was, but I wished I knew. She said that ever since she wasn't the same, and has been told by others that there was something attached to her, but never believed it.Before her telling me that she sold her soul, my angel told me all about it. I just kept it to myself to understand what was happening and not scare her, but after she told me things got really intense between us to the point that another month or so went by and we broke up. After she left my apartment was clear and all that tension was released. if I wasn't brave, I believe I would completely drop this subject and move on, but I have this responsibility to take action still. I won't give up.Now let's just say that this is all in my mind and I have built this character based on my experiences. If it's true and all goes well, I will succeed. If it's all part of my imagination, then I'll know once I reach end that I gave it my all. I won't live with regrets.Overall I have a lot of examples that I can share, and perhaps it would be best if you knew me in person to understand me better, but you do have a great point. I don't know how I could measure my loyalty, bravery, and leadership skills, but I can tell you that I want to be the best I can be. For my family, my friends, and for everyone else. I'll make sure to keep this in mind as I go.\"\n",

He desperately wanted Lovren to come good so he kept playing him, everyone knows what Ballotelli can do when he can be bothered but obviously he never seemed like he was and with Gerrard I think he didn't know what to do as Gerrard was a living legend at the club and to some was undroppable. I think dropping them for the Madrid game was supposed to be a motivator and it backfired. He was probably guilty of both then. He dropped Suso and Shelvey every few games, I'm sure that's one of the reasons he cited as a reason to why he left. Moreno had the same issues last season, Markovic last season went through a few games where he was playing well then had one off game then was dropped. It arguably happened to Assaidi (I admit he wasn't good enough) I think BR would have done better if he had a bit more trust in some of his players because that showed in some of their performances but as you said there were players that were also seemed undroppable by BR so he was guilty of both and both arguably led to his downfall.|||FIRMINO!!!!!|||Lallana dribble though!!|||The Torygraph jumped the gun a little there didn't they?|||I think the best bet is the potential coalition partners to be honest.

I have a very emotionaly distant relationship with my dad. I try to get along with him but it doesn't seem to work. I'm now at the point that soon as I move out I am going to break contact with my dad and my older brother. Probably not so much my dad but my older brother definitely. Anyway onto my upbringing. I've been to 11 different schools, lived on two continents. I'm from the UK and when I was younger we moved to New Jersey until we moved back because my parents got divorced. When we moved back to the UK that's when my 7 years of hell began. I started getting bullied at school. I'm not sure why, maybe because I had an American accent, maybe because I was a little bit different, maybe a little of both. My mum met her future ex husband. He was abusive, rarely physically(it did happen when he was drunk) but the majority of time it was emotional. He was a sergeant in the army and he treated us like \\\"soldiers.\\\" He used to use stuff against me like saying my depression wasn't real, that I was making it up and depression isn't real. A few years later he used my mums depression against me saying that I helped cause it and that I was basically the antichrist. He used to yell at me for the pettiest of things. He didn't just yell for a short time, it would go on for hours and hours. I could go on for a lot longer about how horrible he was but that would take so long. You would also think that seeing my dad on weekends would be some sort of sanctuary well you would be wrong. My older brother was abusive to me, he used to beat me and was genuinely horrible to me. It got so bad once one of his friends stepped in and told him \\\"to leave me a fuck alone\\\" my dad now denies that my brother was ever abusive to me. My dad definitely favours my other brothers which is definitely not in my head as my mum and grand parents and even my younger brother has noticed(I don't know if my older brother has noticed because I don't speak to him unless it's about football) My younger brother is the favourite. For my prom my parents wouldn't let me buy a suit but had to rent one which isn't so bad but my dad outright bought my younger brothers suit which he has to \\\"pay\\\" him back for. He bought my younger brother an expensive racing bike despite for years him saying no to me for me wanting one. There's plenty of incidents like that. I know gifts aren't the be all and end all of everything but my gifts pale in comparison by a long stretch.Over the last 2 or 3 years I have slowly started to get my life back together. I've been to see a therapist, I've started to discover hobbies I enjoy and I'm to make new friends within these hobbies. I'm 21 now. I'm going back to college to study Psychology.

This is a win for the far right, hopefully the left who wanted to leave can rally around and fight back. I was on the fence on this vote to be honest. I dislike a lot of things about the EU especially the way it's treated Greece but then all the major arguments I saw for leave did not appeal to me in the slightest. I did listen to left leave arguments and agreed with them but at the end of the day the right would have won if we stayed or remained, just one would have been an easier pill to swallow.|||English Disco League?

Immigration is easily handled but mass immigration which causes an excess of labour which then causes people to want to work for less therefore pushing down the wage people are willing to work at and causing a race to the bottom. Then if there is a surplus of workers then it undermines strikes as the staff would be easily replaceable. This happened a couple of months a go where I work when the logistics team threatened to strike and the bosses said we can just replace you with x, y and z. The mass immigration is caused by the the freedom of movement inside the EU and as countries like Poland have a weaker economy and with the workers working with a poor wage they naturally will want to do better for themselves and if they can earn more than that on minimum wage somewhere else they will. I don't blame them for doing so. I would do the same if I were them. The excess in workers benefits the ruling class.|||Messi isn't in the top percentage, he is the top percentage.

I once went nearly two years without having sex after splitting up with my ex. I made a joke saying \\\"I'm reclaiming my virginity\\\" He now uses it against me. I've slept with 3 people since making that joke but he still uses it because apparently me not sleeping with over 50 girls does not make me a man.

It's also ridiculous how much the workers in London get payed considering how expensive it is to even afford to live there let alone actually being able to have fun.I'm quite lucky living in Preston in a way. I can stay out of the bars/clubs that cost more and stick to the pubs. The pub I normally go in has decent priced pints if I'm honest and they have deals on during the weak where for a pint of Guinness is only Â£2.60.

You have to be a moron to think that the EU is perfect but I digress. One of the major things for me was freedom of movement because in the career I'm thinking of going in to I could move out onto mainland Europe. I had resigned myself into thinking that wasn't going to be so simple anymore until my friend mentioned he's applying for an Irish passport as his grandparents are Irish. I didn't actually think I could apply for an Irish passport as it's my great Grandma who's Irish and you can only apply if it's your grandparents but apparently if say my mum or my grandma apply for a passport it then means I then apply for a passport, convenient loop hole, no? Well I brought this idea up to my Brexiter mum and grandma and I apparently I have to grow up and get over the decision which I have done but I would have thought maybe they would have thrown me a bone or something considering it'd make not only my life easier to move where I want but also their lives easier when they go on holiday.|||You've ruined Hedwig for me now!|||Yeah based on the subreddits you're subscribed to.|||Well Gerrard did get arrested so that much is definitely true.

Watch our penalty shootouts with Mignolet in goal he will dive the same way everytime with a right footed penalty taker. It's painful to watch. I won't take that go against him though because even Edwin Van Der Saar had a very similar pattern to Mignolet which is demonstrated in their Champions League final against Chelsea. Only when Anelka stepped up did Van Der Saar change his game plan. Even Manuel Neuer has a pattern. Albeit a different pattern but a pattern non the less.|||Yeah I just say \\\"some website I use\\\"|||Why? Why not vote Green?

Yes there were times he does come off as a dick like throwing darts at kids but it's the other stories I can't help but love. He genuinely has a huge heart. One story that broke my heart was when he was on a date with one of his ex girlfriends, they came across a box with puppies up for adoption. There was two left. He asked his girlfriend if she wanted a puppy which she said yes, he picked it up and gave it to her. Mario then went back and picked up the other puppy and said \\\"I can't leave him by himself\\\" clearly showing what has affected him in his life. That's heartbreaking too. That's something that could destroy a person. It's clear as day really why he doesn't show he's interested in a game which he may feel that has quite clearly rejected him. It's sad people are going to use him as a cautionary tale saying this guy had it all but there are so many people who are short sited and don't see how the constant media attacking, racism from fans you've worked your whole life trying to impress and then to top it all off what has happened to him in his developmental years. The fact is, many abandoned/orphaned children turn to a life of crime, drugs etc and for Mario to beat that is exceptional. Mario should be a cautionary tale but not for young players but for the rest of us. We can't judge someone until we've walked a mile in their shoes. So fucking what if he's on Â£150k a week. Money does not make up for the hole in your life that has been missing.Sorry about the rant, I'm quite emotional about topics like these as I've suffered through depression, anxiety and other things in my life. It's something I feel strongly about and there have been days I've also wanted to throw darts at people.|||I went canvassing in Stoke on the weekend and it honestly scares me that this guy may very well win the by election. People were either switching to UKIP or can't vote for a Labour party with Corbyn as leader. If UKIP wins Stoke it may cause a domino affect in the Labour heartlands leading to a far right party becoming more and more influential. He's already shown he's not bothered about lying whether about where he lives or majorly sensitive topics like Hillsborough. I hope that he doesn't win in Stoke but he may very well just do that from what I've seen.|||I do agree he was the best option but when we appointed him as captain it didn't fill me with a great amount of confidence to be honest. Who else is there in the team you'd make captain? Milner? Would have been unfair to make him captain when he first joined. Skrtel? Barely leads a defensive line let alone a whole team. Toure? Experienced enough but not a starter. The only logical player would be Henderson.|||So it'd be really handy for you then.

Yes his command of the box isn't great, his aerial ability has been wanting at times (he has improved a lot since first signing to be fair to him) and the less said about his distribution the better but he is arguably one of the best shot stoppers in the league. No he's not as good as De Gea or Courtois but then again few are. He's one of the the better keepers in the league for me.|||Don't get why he's getting downvoted just for being a United fan?

Milner ticked all my reservation boxes of playing him at left back. Those reservations come with any player who is used to playing on the right hand side and being right footed. Sure Milner has a decent left foot but his instincts are going to make him cut inside which unless you're a certain type of player it is going to slow the game down a lot.|||I realised I have got all the top grades I need to get into my first choice uni the other night after thinking for ages I had to get 4 more distinctions but I have already got that so I just need 4 merits which is great news.

I was still disappointed though.I'm  not sure how to do hide spoilers so if you don't want any don't read on.I don't understand how she was a cursed child? Just because she's Voldemorts daughter? I think that's a bit unfair to be honest, I mean Salazar Slytherins family married muggle borns and one even married a muggle. I was excited to see what Harry's life would be like as an auror while trying to have a decent family life but he's now the Minister of Magical Law Enforcement which doesn't seem to fit Harry at all, maybe he becomes a professor later in life. That would suit him more. I was also a bit disappointed that they couldn't create an original strong without having a direct connection to Voldemort in some way. It'd be OK if the villain was inspired by Voldemort, that would be fine but bring him back to life? No.There's other things that bugged me a bit but I haven't really thought about that much but these are the points that I keep coming back to.|||Thanks mate.

Does that not make everyone involved in wars murderers? Yes the IRA killed British citizens but so did the British army. Also not every person who calls them murderers have had people die in their families or had people they know affected. Let's take the Manchester United and West Brom game this season when James McClean refused to wear a poppy during the game for justified reasons and then proceeded to get booed for 90 minutes. Did all the 70k+ United fans have someone in their family or someone they know affected? Some of them most likely, not all. The thing I was trying to point out was that it is now a value consensus in Britain that if someone who shows any slight sympathy towards the IRA cause comes under attack from people. Look at what happened to Jeremy Corbyn, he got attacked and was accused of being a terrorist sympathiser and in turn an IRA sympathiser.I also understand that the original meaning of the poppy is to remember the World Wars but as time goes on those meanings adapt and it's a way to remember all the fallen in all the wars which we should do but the wars Britain has entered should be open to criticism especially in most recent history. If Corbyn was in charge instead of Thatcher (obviously not a real life situation that was possible) he would have opened negotiations a lot sooner.|||My friend is like that, everything the Tories put out she hates blindly and everything that Jeremy Corbyn says is gospel.

Then when you take into account the US forces have 1.9m firearms while the proletariat have an estimated 320m. More depending on the source.

And what would happen if I tried? I'm quite a neurotic and anxious person and from what I've read this could possibly be connected to being forced to switch hand?

Which wouldn't be hard as my handwriting is more a childish scrawl. It's really embarrassing. Also if it worked would I be able to draw properly?

I know we are going off a smaller sample size but here me out. Under BR when we went to pens Mignolet always dove the same way every time when the player was right footed.

If you don't want to take my word for it, watch our last few penalty shootouts on YouTube and you'll see what I mean. I was pleasantly surprised when Mignolet dove the right way near enough everytime tonight and long that may continue.A side note, this is not a knock on Mignolet at all.

Naturally thr first I signed up for was the Socialist society. I presume you want to be a writer now? Why not become a professor and write at the same time? Or is it you now want to be a publisher? I don't think not taking those classes or joining those clubs will be detrimental, it may cause an impact you just need to sell yourself to every publisher out there.That's actually sort of similar to what I want to be honest, I'm kind of hoping my grandparents will leave me their cottage but I have a feeling they'll pass it down their children who would then sell it off.I've not read that but I do agree with what you said.

There were flashes of happiness but Harry's head was a complete mess that year, what with Cedric dying and never really talking about it to anyone while most likely suffering PTSD. Then on top of that, the authoritarian regime at Hogwarts with Umbridge, being banned from playing Quidditch, his visions of Voldemort and Sirius dying. To top it all off he was behind on school work and had to endure a former of torture in detention with Umbridge so overall OotP was quite a gloomy book. That's not to say there weren't happy moments like with the DA, Cho and probably as you say some fun conversations. Book 6 was quite a lot less gloomy in my opinion and had quite a lot of happy moments despite Dumbledore dying.|||Oh, I'm not disputing Brits go as some of my family has just got back from Orlando themselves.

Smelling maybe but De Gea?|||These videos were posted when he joined Chelsea not recently and that's the point that was being made. I will admit that many Liverpool fans did detest him for awhile, myself included. I however started to like him again long before he left Chelsea.

(obviously not his fault he couldn't)|||[Well Boycotts do work](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cottage_cheese_boycott) but the issue is getting enough people to actually care about the cause. People complain about how much money is in football now but nobody wants to boycott the likes of Sky Sports because that would mean not being able to watch their team play. Instead they organise boycotts in stadiums which are effectively useless. I don't think using the Hillsborough Disaster as a reason to boycott the paper would work (even though it should) because many people actually still believe it was Liverpool fans fault even after the decisions by the court this year and the report released a few years ago. Then there's other people who'd still buy the paper to spite the club. Then there's the people who actually think it's a decent paper.Edit: Another issue with boycotts is that boycotters start too large of a target in which many people don't actually  believe that it will make a difference even though it would. The boycott I linked was a very minor boycott but the boycotts didn't stop there and it actually gave people confidence to take on bigger targets. They actually won a few as well, including house pricing with a similar situation to what is happening in London right now. I'm not saying it'll work every time but they can work but a lot of it comes down to chance and luck. I recommend having a read through the book \\\"Blueprint for Revolution\\\" (not as ominous as it sounds.)

Plus there's always peer pressure to deal with. I was with my ex girlfriend for 11 months before we had sex and that was because she didn't want to have sex before marriage. I never pressurised her, I did the complete opposite and told her she should do it when she's ready. She wanted to do it for a months before but was conflicted because of religion. I was very supportive of her.My friends on the hand gave me endless abuse for being a relationship that long and not having sex and they pressured me to pressure her so even though there is no rush, you also have to remember of the social pressures young people are under and at the end of the day no matter how much you tell your kids otherwise you can't control what their friends are saying.|||That would do very nicely!|||Were United fans just singing \\\"da  da da da, your songs are shite\\\"|||Were United fans just singing \\\"da  da da da, your songs are shite\\\"|||I did notice when I went on holiday last year I had more tea than usual.|||Not even surprised|||I buy quite a lot of clothes from charity shops or from eBay etc and my older brother mocks me for it.

Book 6 he actually apparates with Dumbledore albeit not inside the house though and not a magical item.Edit: Book 3 he doesn't get in trouble for using the night bus and book 2 he doesn't get in trouble for getting away in a flying car. He actually uses magical items quite a bit outside Hogwarts if you think about it.|||I think that's because if you play football manager or some other football game, most of the time 7 is the average for how your players performed. Obviously 5 makes more sense though.|||It sounded like a good half of a stadium to me!|||I love going abroad by myself. I don't know what it is but I prefer doing that than going abroad with a few mates.

Instead he's got Benteke, Ings, Origi and Sturridge. Sturridge when he's not injured is one of the best strikers in the world. The jury is still out on Ings and Origi. Benteke despite being decent in our first few games he doesn't have the mobility and speed which would compliment Coutinho but hopefully I'll be proven wrong as the season goes on.|||I think for me it depends on context. I'm not sure on the context but I do definitely change between the two depending on what I'm talking about.|||This sounds quite intriguing, I'll have to give it a listen when I'm done with the audiobooks.|||You don't often come across a fellow Brit on this sub.

There's so many decent strikers Liverpool have had over the years, Ian St John, John Aldridge and John Toshack who are much more loved by Liverpool fans. Even as a player Owen wasn't as loved as he perhaps should have been. Other than that the Liverpool team looks great!|||I feel like that something Brendan Rodgers did right, he bought players who could fit into certain positions in case of an emergency however he never really signed any specialised players which is arguably what we need.|||I've heard Spurs sing it like that and Southampton too. It's not just Liverpool fans who do it. It's not always when the teams is losing either. I do agree though I prefer the other way but I still don't mind this way.|||That's the best thing about statistics.

Sure there is that element and it is that element that is mostly shown in the media but the majority of people who are voting leave are worried about how many immigrants are coming in to the country. This is not actually nationalistic, racist or xenophobic. The problem is that parties like UKIP, BNP and Britain First do not seem to allow for a sensible debate on immigration and if you try to do so you are labelled a nationalist. I've been called a nationalist during the referendum for mentioning immigration for one of my reasons I'm thinking of voting leave because apparently my view on immigration is nationalistic which it is not.|||I had this happen to me twice. The first time I went back to my book and checked how to spell it and got it right. I knew I had got it right. The girl who went after me spelt it the same way. The other time was when I used to live in the US. I'm originally from the UK so I can you guess what I got told I spelt wrong? Colour, I spelt the British way not the American way. Why could they not let that slide as they knew I was English and technically wasn't wrong either.|||Banning guns is not like banning alcohol.|||This.

Yes he still is an annoying 16 year old kid (I'm 21) but now we go to the cinema together, plady video games together, watch the same shows, go on bike rides etc but when it comes to beliefs on things we do differ so we don't talk about it and he's only 16 so he's still growing and some of those beliefs are changing. I feel like I've helped those beliefs change as well I feel. Saying all that I still do don't get on with my older brother no matter how hard I try. He just ends up making feel like I'm small and pathetic. He tries to put me down at every corner to make him seem better than me. My mum told me she believes that he's jealous of me because I've always been able make friends easily and he doesn't so he takes it out on me to make him feel better about myself.

You can't just leave us out at sea|||The problem with that analogy is that if you take the gamble on a game show and it goes wrong, worst case scenario is that you go back to your ordinary life a bit disappointed but nothings changed however taking a gamble on leaving the EU and it goes wrong, the worst case scenario is that we end up in a great recession like in 2009 and like last time they'll use the taxpayers money to bail out the banks but unlike last time we don't have as much money in the treasury as the deficit has doubled ever since the Tories took charge meaning we have not as much money to bail out the banks and Gordon Brown already sold our gold so what will they do instead? They'll turn to the NHS, sell that off because atleast now they'll have a solid reason to do so, they'll privatise the police force (which they are trying to do) privatise our prisons and the lives of the working class becomes harder 10 fold. Not only that, industries such as the agriculture industry will collapse as they rely on foreign workers so we would have to buy more from abroad meaning we'd be buying food at inflated prices making it harder for people to live and causing more people to live in poverty.

I also found the writing cringe worthy however the commentary in the Stephen Fry audiobooks was brilliant. It reminded me of when you watch old football (soccer) games and how the commentators used to speak. Well up until the 6th book anyway when they started using Luna and Zacharias Smith. I also noticed that some of the language used was written by someone who's not got a keen interest in sport. An example being, instead of saying the keeper stopped/blocked the shot, JK used the keeper stopped/blocked the goal. The only people I've ever heard say it that way are people who don't have any interest in sport or that particular sport.|||Where abouts in the UK did you go?

Yes the quality may not be as good but you shouldn't support a team on how good they are. So I agree you are getting fair value to watch the team you support.

Also you do realise that America is famous for its on set films (obviously there are exceptions) while a lot of European films are filmed on site. I also find that European films seem a lot grittier and look like hard work has gone into it while American films tend to be a lot more flashy (yes, American films do have a lot of hard work behind them) which there is nothing wrong with but I prefer the grittier films but then again I am from Northern England so I probably can relate to it more.|||Evolution not revolution then?|||Holy shit!

My grandma and my dad actually suggested to me to sell out my morals for the sake of living an easier life... Then because I mentioned I wanted to work for a charity they started going on about disabilities (charity wise) and it sounded like they were suggesting that charities for disabled people is a bad thing and even went on to say that disabled people can work because a lad my dad knows who's disabled is a delivery man. I'm sure if I pushed it they would have defended the tax cut against disabled people! Then to top it all off my grandma said \\\"I think you're wrong and people should put themselves first\\\" \\\"charity starts at home\\\" etc I'm the sort of person who thinks the majority should come before the individual.

All I said was how can one country demand an apology from another for their atrocities during WWII while on the other hand refusing to apologise for the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

He may not have answered the question but he did mention that's not part of his platform.|||I must admit I'm not a huge fan of guns myself but I do understand the need for them when it comes to the left. I started off the research as solidly for gun control but as I went along it ended up being a call for arms and the destruction capitalism.One thing I am not convinced of though is that guns are necessarily a good form of protection. I understand in some circumstances which happen very rarely especially in places with strict gun control like the UK (where I live) they could be used as a form of protection however these situations could be prevented with the necessary precautions especially with someone breaking into your home which in a lot of cases if both parties have a gun someone is going to shot while contrary to popular belief, people do not actually want to shoot someone else even if they have broken into your house. I don't think someone who breaks into your house is a \\\"bad guy\\\" but just another victim of the capitalist system.I am also quite sympathetic towards hunting to be honest. Hunting just because you can I do not agree with but hunting to get food or culling (if there is actually a reason to cull) I can get behind. Or even keeping the population in check like we do with pheasants in the country. Fox and badger hunting not so much as the people who do it because they're sick, twisted individuals who get thrills killing them in barbaric ways.As I said though I am against gun control for revolution purposes.|||Oh thanks, now I have imagery as well as cringing.|||I think he ded.|||I've been quite lucky in the fact I never really got spots on my face when I was a teen.

I think why people get defensive may not be over the app itself but it may feel like people are attacking how the person chooses to live their life. The app will definitely play apart in some people though.I must admit my opinion of Pokemon Go has changed slightly when videos of people playing it in the thousands at parks literally running to the same location. It does seem like it could cause problems for people not playing it in public spaces as they are now surrounded by people who are not looking where they are going.

I'd still follow the club to see how they were doing but a massive hole will be ripped out of my heart.

It doesn't make me any friends and do expect to get hacked at some point down the line though.|||I can answer that for you. Lack of competition. Look who's he had for competition. He was 3rd choice behind Carragher and Agger for awhile but as Agger was injury probe he started. Ever since then who? Kyrgiakos was never any better than him, Toure despite showing signs of early promise didn't live up to what we hoped he would be. Lovren was poor last season and despite improving still hasn't been great this season either. Gomez? An 18 year old, you'd be a brave manager to do so especially at a club like Liverpool and then you get Sakho who in my opinion is leagues ahead of Skrtel but what let's him down is that he looks really awkward on the ball and for some reason Brendan has something against him.|||Hitlers favourite place in the UK was Blackpool.

The same people who made Despicable Me.|||So far I've only read his books so I'm interested what his talks would be like. My friend invited me along with her. I can agree with that sentiment and I even see that in some of the Corbyns policies as well. An example being him not putting in getting rid of the monarchy (unlike the Greens) as he probably sees it as a battle for a later date which is understandable. As much as it pains me, we won't be getting rid of the monarchy any time soon, maybe when the Queen dies? I know a lot of people aren't fans of Charles and Camilla and according to Owen Jones in 'The Establishment' neither are they. I'll obviously learn more about the battles that should be picked when I go see him next month.Could elaborate on what he said on this topic just in case it doesn't come up when I go.

He still wears Nike Airs, it's a funny sight.|||I'd be OK not conceding.|||My opinion on him isn't just based off of this season, it's based off since the World Cup in which I wasn't as impressed by him as a lot of people were and also based off of his performance last season so my opinion is not reactionary however despite all this, I hope he changes my mind. I will not change my mind after one decent performance though.|||The only times I feel like I need a best friend is if I want to go see a film or try out a new cafe/restaurant I've discovered.

I know a few people who refuse to vote Labour because they don't feel like Labour connects with them so they choose to vote Lib Dem or Tory instead.

He also mentioned that he remembered being dragged out of his house when he was young because their street had been set on fire.  I do feel like there was more to what he wanted to say but I think he held back a bit on his reasoning because one of the parents from the Warrington bombings was also a quest speaker at the seminar. I would have liked to have learnt more about what he was saying but for time and him seemingly holding back. I know he said he's an atheist so there is that too. I was the only person on my college course who actually liked him the rest called him a hypocrite.|||Surely it was just an F at best since you weren't in Kentucky?|||Sadly it's because many people believe that having to see a councillor, psychiatrist etc is a sign of weakness which is not the case.

Dominique wasn't the prettiest but that was probably the closest I've come to love at first sight.|||I also covered that as well. I'm not completely against hosting sporting events but what I found was there were a lot of lies saying that it would boost the economy through tourism etc but when I looked into it there was a drop in tourism. I covered the good and bad sides to it not just saying \\\"look how awful the World Cup is.\\\" I just think going forward that it should be made clear that it won't bring that much money if any money into the country. It does however create a togetherness which I think we all can benefit from in this day and age when everything feels like it's getting further apart. I loved the Olympics being in London.

I agree it's an unfair comparison to even suggest. It is however how the media have portrayed all Brexit voters unfortunately, even if a good chunk do fit that description.Yeah. I don't have a problem with right wing papers (I'm a leftist) such as the Telegraph or the Times as they actually have decent journalism even if I don't agree with their ideology. The likes of the Daily Mail on the other hand I despise. They promote nothing but hate and bigotry. They have helped stir this nasty debate. They've also got a history of this, they actively supported Hitler up until WWII. They even compared Jews to rats and nothings changed except it's no longer Jews they're attacking, it's Muslims.Yeah Johnson disappeared while Farage was a \\\"sore winner.\\\" How an earth he was an EU minister for 17 years ridiculous. He never turned up to make a difference, he just complained about it.|||It probably wouldn't be any worse to be honest but I think the benefit of it for Perks is that it moves the story along nicely. Only going over key moments which sometimes books do a whole lot of filler but you're right it probably wouldn't have made much difference if I'm being honest.|||I agree with this. If you compare me to my two brothers then we're nothing a like in that respect. My dad had more involvement in how they were brought and it shows because they're both more likely to get into fights than I am, both are interested in the forces while my younger brother is planning on joining the marines after he's finished college while with me my dad had less involvement with my mum looking after me more than he did. I played with dolls as a kid, I was into musical theatre basically the complete opposite of my brothers and I think it shows in what we all studied in college as well. My brothers both did Public Services while I chose to do Sociology and Politics. There's nothing wrong with the choosing to do what they did and there should be nothing wrong in what I choose to do despite it being a female dominated course.|||Was that before or after the SUV?|||I'll put that into an edit.

I used to live in New Jersey before moving back to the UK when I was 11 and I remember every morning being forced by my teacher to say the Pledge. I know now I didn't have to and wasn't supposed to do it, but what is a child supposed to do when a teacher yells at you for not wanting to say the Pledge? It always came back to some shit on how they beat us in the Revolutionary War so I had to say it. Looking back that's basically oppression. There's also so many things wrong with that teacher said but I'm on my phone and can't be bothered.|||John Oliver is the guy from Community right? I hadn't heard of him before that.

That's the problem with quantitative data you can use it to support your own ends (not saying you are doing this) if you don't look into it further. What we should be looking into is not that single parent children are more likely to be criminals because their parents have split up, we should be looking at why that is. What this data doesn't tell me is whether the children grow up in lower socio-economic areas or not, as most schools in lower socio-economic areas actually have poorer schools which does have an effect on how well someone does in education. Having a poorer education can then lead to criminal behaviour as people can't afford the material goods they want. Yes you can say if they can't afford, don't turn to a life of crime in order to get material wants but the problem is we have advertisements being shoved down our throats 24/7 telling you, you need to get this or that. It's hard to escape from. You then could tell them to get a job. They might not know where to begin with finding a job and not realise that they could go through a job agency and even through a job agency you're not guaranteed work every week. What about the job centre? In my experience the job centre doesn't offer much help and actually try their best to make you not to give you your JSA. The truth is that the idea the \\\"underclass\\\" don't want to work is a myth. I won't deny some don't want to work but most actually have conventional views on life. It's not as saying this is what the statistics show, we have to ask why?|||I know he didn't spit his dummy out at Liverpool, I can understand why you thought I did say that though. My wording was wrong. If anything he actually was pretty well behaved though but as I said he did seem pretty lazy on the pitch at times. Yes he has scored goals at everywhere he's been but he's also gone through spells of not scoring at all. Didn't he only score one goal in his final season at City?|||Exactly! He just got so confused the poor lad. The thing is he had mentioned a few times he's part this and part that so it made me wonder what else he thinks he is but isn't and where he has picked this up from.|||Apparently not amazing.|||I know that feeling.

There's not much to do in Preston if I'm honest however Preston has very good rail service. You can get direct trains to many of the main cities in the UK from there. London, Manchester, Liverpool. Edinburgh and Glasgow are the ones I can think of so if you ever do come even if it is for a day or two you always have the option to go to one of the nearby cities. Preston is also near the Ribble Valley and that is beautiful. It is believed that the Ribble Valley was the inspiration for the Shire in Lord of the Rings, there's even a walk you can do called the Tolkien trail if you are interested in that sort of thing? There's also the Lancashire archives which you could go to, to find out more about your families history. Despite how plain Preston is now, Preston does have a lot of history which if you were interested you could research more about it. I'm not the authority on Prestonian history though. It's amazing how small a world we live in isn't it?|||The thing about stereotypes is that there is a truth to them. No, they're not 100% but there no smoke without fire so to speak.

If they do lose and we capitalise by beating Bournemouth and Everton mid week we'd only be 3 points behind City and 2 behind United. City also still have Arsenal to play so maybe Arsenal could do us a favour but we'd have to win every game from now on and hope other results go our way but we're Liverpool we will somehow still fuck that up.|||Funnily enough Preston fans do this when the team gets relegated and then have a resurrection when the team gets promoted. 2000 people turned up to it when they got promoted last season.|||I always thought Martin catered to a younger audience as well?|||I'm going to suggest putting /s at the end next time so people realise you're joking.|||If we win our group we will get Northern Ireland if that happens.|||It seems like all those Tory MP ESA memes worked.

I like him as a person and I like the fact he doesn't care about his appearance but unfortunately people think politicians should dress smartly. Some people are shallow enough to not vote for him because of it. He's not the stereotypical smooth talking, charismatic leader, then again neither was Attlee, that's bot to say I'm comparing the two. Unfortunately we live in a world where the smooth talking, charismatic leader is what's desired despite its often the smooth talkers who tend to fuck people over. There's so much more I like about him such as not singing the national anthem as he's a republican and to me that shows man of principle and again unfortunately that doesn't resonate with the rest of the public because apparently not singing the national anthem doesn't mean you love your country. Who would I replace Corbyn with? I have no idea. I don't know enough about Owen Smith and Angela Eagle does not inspire confidence for me. To replace Corbyn with Eagle would be a huge mistake in my opinion. Having Eagle would be like having a chihuahua fighting a pitbull and having Corbyn is like having an old and tired staffy fighting a pitbull. No matter who we have as leader we cannot have a snap general election, we'd get ripped to pieces at this point in time and I have a feeling the Lib Dems are going to have a resurgence this time around, nowhere near as strong as 2010 but they will pick up more seats.|||Dark brown.

It could be a last minute winner in an important/end to end game. It could be (as OP did say) the community its self, hell it could just be one player you like so tou decide to support the club he is currently at. I like a lot of Liverpool fans got it from my dad who is also a Liverpool fan and it helped he had a season ticket at the time. My point is sometimes you choose to support a club not because of researching their history and current team and where they are in the league but just because you have an attraction to that club.|||Not really, I guarantee the vast majority of people have no idea who she is therefore meaning she isn't a famous actress.

I was probably a bit more extraverted then but then I moved to a new village. It isn't far from where my friends live but it was far enough. That made me become a bit more introverted and then my girlfriend broke up with me and I found out a few of my closest friends had spread rumours about me and still do when I try to reach out to them. So this has caused me to withdraw more and then getting bullied from one of the bosses at work didn't help. He questioned my lifestyle and in turn this made me question myself a lot and now I enjoy being by myself. I have friends but I don't really see them because I don't feel that much of a connection with them. I feel like I'm different to them. One of them pointed it out but not in a horrible way.

When I'm sites like Facebook, Twitter and even Reddit you see people spouting this anti-bullying stuff and posting it as their statuses and what not but these same people have shunned people for being weird. I moved around a lot as a kid so I went to quite a few different schools and always got accepted into the \\\"popular\\\" kids for about a week before they realised I was a bit weird or i found people I had more in common with. I always thought this was how things were done but then one day I was no longer the new kid. Two new lads started on the same day and the nicest way to put it is that they were not the most fortunate looking and the popular kids shunned them straight away. I spoke to the two new lads straight away because why not? No one is skin deep right? People came up to me asking me why am I talking to them, their weird.My point being is these same people are the ones who seem to me on my Facebook anyway to be the ones who put all the \\\"look at me, look at how lovely of a person I am\\\" things up but in the same instance will turn their nose up at someone without getting to know them.

No, the EU is not perfect and I do not support many things the EU has done such as what's happening to Greece right now but I think the EU is the basis of something much much better. There is good in what the EU is doing. The free labour movement I think it is a great thing, again it's not perfect but it is definitely something that should be built upon. From my experience of working out in the fields on farms, in greenhouses etc there are plenty of benefits of being in the EU. The fact that many salad pickers, nursery workers, factory workers etc are from outside of the UK says something to me. I rarely come across English people working in those jobs. The only exceptions are young lads who have been brought up in agricultural, horticultural etc backgrounds but these are only stop gap positions and I truly do not blame people. These are thankless jobs. There are other benefits from being in the EU. Cheaper travel, when the UK doesn't grow enough food in the winter we get it imported from Spain, a somewhat borderless region. Yes, you still have to use passports but you don't have to have a visa to go to another country. Roaming charges are cheaper and they are working on making it free across the EU. Imagine not having to spend a fortune texting one of your family members that you're having a great time in Barcelona. The EU will only improve if given time to sort out its teething problems. That's why I'll be voting 'in' in the referendum.|||There's a few other banned episodes isn't there? Admittedly I'm not sure where about they are in the series.|||I try and boycott anything to do with Rupert Murdoch especially 'The S*n'. It's quite easy for most of what he owns especially since National Geographic has gone to shit in recent years turning from educational programmes to reality TV and even Shark Week is awful. They had programmes about \\\"Could there be a megashark in the ocean?\\\" and fucking mermaids. Sky however is slightly harder to ignore when I go round my mums she owns Sky and when her boyfriend has the football on I can't ignore it, I normally try to stream as much as possible but when I watch games at the pub with my mates I then can't ignore it then. Plus Game of Thrones is on Sky but I do tend to stream that. Then there's the X-men films that I enjoy, I like going to the cinema as I enjoy the cinematic ambience so I can't ignore Murdoch that way either unless I wait until a decent copy is online to stream but that could take months if ever.The other big one I would love to boycott but is infinitely times harder to boycott is Disney but my God do they produce so much of my favourite stuff it pains me especially when you through the list of what they own and how much of their media you can consume without realising is staggering.I do try and get second hand products and clothes as much as possible despite derision from some family members. Some family members look down upon it, others think I'm just being thrifty and tell me it's the good honest conservative values they instilled in me... then there's only my mum and one set of grandparents who encourage me to do this. That set of grandparents are from working class backgrounds 90% of the rest of my family vote Tory (ones a Tory MP I won't state who for obvious reasons) and a good chunk of that are petite bourgeois I guess? My parents are divorced and I grew up with my mum so that probably explains me.I live in a run down town/city in the UK so organic food is off the table for now until I start Uni later this year but I'm planning on going pescatarian when I start. I do use non-animal tested toiletries, this doesn't go down well with some family members as they have strong peppermint \\\"natural\\\" smells which they're not really used to. I also try and walk and bike everywhere however I may have cheated a little bit because my bike is a Â£2k bike but I did get it second hand though... and it is in red so it's got that's got it going for it right? I also don't follow many cultural phenomena. I don't use Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat etc I barely even use Facebook. I don't listen to mainstream media and I don't even know what's in the charts right now or what's even popular. I just know every now and then someone asks me \\\"have you seen this?\\\" and it's about something Beyonce or someone like that has done or the most recent \\\"challenge\\\" and they act completely shocked when I've said I've not heard of it. I'm quite often a couple of months behind. I even ignore the majority of Reddit nowadays as it just makes me angry while reading the comments. I get most of my news from either r/Socialism etc, 'The Independent', the \\\"Socialist\\\" Facebook groups I'm apart of or weirdly enough r/ShitLiberalsSay or/ShitAmericansSay  I've actually boycotted buying anything Liverpool FC related partly due to it being so expensive and also due to knowing that the only reason the prices for tickets, shirts, merchandise etc is so high is because they know the fans will pay for it no matter what. The recent fan walkout was successful but to me this was 15 year to late. Despite winning that battle sadly the fans are losing the war. EA, I don't own anything EA any more. They frequently produce sub par games which are bug filled (like many games I may add, they just do it more frequently than others) and they don't care because people will buy their games every year despite producing the same games with little improvements over and over again, the fan base know this but they won't boycott.|||I've got a half Liverpool and half Celtic scarf.

I noticed in the recent by election there was an AV like vote as I out 1st choice Green and 2nd choice Labour.I agree it does show how crazy our nation has become.

I just found I losty competitiveness as I got older. I also gave up playing because I wasn't enjoying it as much anymore and plus I don't really like the types of people who play football over here in the UK. Obviously not all people can be put into that category because I did make a few friends but they were the anomaly not the rule. I've always been good at most teams sports because a lot of the skills are interchangeable for example I had never played field hockey before but because I'm a defender in football I was able to transfer my defensive awareness over to hockey.I'm more into solo sports now like cycling and running. Not just because I enjoy them but it gives me some alone time just me and my own thoughts. I've found those thoughts are different to the ones I have when I go for my late night walks as I am constantly telling myself to ignore the pain, especially if I'm climbing a steep hill on my bike. I've not been cycling as much recently because I kind of want someone to come cycling with me.

Sure we have a few players who can play out there if need be but not as first choice.I still don't think we should have brought Rashford even if he did play well for the 10 minutes he played in the Euros.

So they have no way to earn a living so resort to crime again. No, that can't be it. They are clearly criminals because that's their nature.|||I'm saving this for later when I've finished work.

The problem we've had IMO over the years is that when we need depth we sign players as backups which isn't a problem in itself but I think you should buy players to come into the first team and relegate the previous first team player to a back up which would then hopefully push him to improve himself and fighting for a first team place causing a good rotation option. It's what the best clubs do.|||I agree with you I've never heard that reason either. God forbid if you say you're a republican though sometimes I wonder why I open my mouth. I got asked by someone on my college course what I thought about Jeremy Corbyn not singing the national anthem, apparently my answer of \\\"good, I don't sing it either\\\" was not efficient enough.|||Yeah I know.

I've met so many like minded people which definitely helps but even the ones who aren't have been great and there the ones who I'm hanging round with. However the only issue is that because the people I hang round with are southerners, I am starting to sound posh. This guy asked me where I was from and I said Preston and he said before that which I replied Preston and asked why. He responded with, you sound like you should be from Cambridge... even so I'm loving it and I can feel myself coming out of my shell a lot more. Sorry for the ramble but it is free 'Freetalk Friday.'

The thing is Pokemon Go has done good things for some people, such as people who are depressed, anxiety issues or just general recluses. They are leaving the house and getting to meet new people which is only a good thing. It's unfortunate that it's Pokemon Go that has encouraged them to go out but atleast they've left the house.|||I'd let her go blind.

It's a long 4 years afterall and who knows what sort of position we will be in  in 2020. Hopefully there's not another \\\"Falklands\\\" scenario which sways everyone to believing that the Tory government is the best thing ever. I'm also hoping Corbyn won't be coming up against Boris either, people seem to love Boris which makes him a lot scarier than David Cameron.|||I thought I had dislocated my thumb about a month ago while playing football(soccer) with some people from work. My thumb had come out of place and you could move it around in the joint. This lad who was there came up to me yesterday he dislocated his finger playing rugby and he had to be put on gas to pop it back into place so I couldn't have dislocated it and proceeded to call me a pussy and made me feel bad for even complaining about it. I don't like this guy very much though.|||I've got the season review aswell.

They do have a point but since the islands are now inhabited by people who identify as British it's made the matters a lot more complicated (nobody lived on the island before hand) so when Top Gear did a special in Patagonia in Argentina some bright spark thought it'd be funny to have the licence plate H982 FKL. Top Gear have feigned ignorance and said they didn't realise but knowing their previous antics I would not be surprised. Argentinian people took offence and it got so bad they had to have a police escort and technically, illegally cross a border to escape.Whether you believe Top Gear producers saying they didn't realise  is totally up to you but I believe they knew what they were doing.|||I work in a greenhouse so you don't understand how many times in a single hour I have to go from wearing just my t-shirt to wearing my hoody and fleece!|||Waiting in a line, in an orderly fashion where no one jumps in front.

I actually didn't want a Facebook account originally but my mum made one for me when I was 14. In all fairness to my mum she made it because I had just moved to the otherside of the country and she thought it would be nice to keep in contact with my friends. I have definetly seen this, people putting status' and probably tweets defending why they are playing Pokemon Go, I just see it as them defending their personal choices more than anything but my small scope on my Facebook does not represent everywhere else.

Teams like Manchester city and Chelsea may have oil rich owners but what's going to happen when they decide to sell up? Trust me you don't want to support a team like that, they're sucking the soul out of football in my opinion. Keep on supporting Tottenham they're a decent team. Yes they may not win much but that's not such a bad thing, there's more to football than winning and losing, it's the community. Find your local Tottenham supporters group and watch games with them and you can share in the ups and downs of the beautiful game that we call football. I'm a Liverpool fan and despite being the most successful team in England(by trophy count not leagues) we have barely won anything for the last 25 years but that's OK, that's when your team actually wins something it feels that much more sweeter. Look at the 2013/14 season when Liverpool took City to basically the final game of the season. Liverpool fans had formed honour guards around the team bus before every game. Some people would call this sad but Liverpool have not won the league for 25 years. They haven't won the league before the name changed to the Premier league and don't other clubs fans let us know about it. You just have to keep going and having faith.Also Tottenham are a top 6 club in England so they do have a chance of winning something.|||The only times I've run into gender neutral toilets in the UK have been at camp sites but even then that's not the norm either.|||I wouldn't say everyone in Europe uses Whatsapp, I know quite a few people who don't.|||What's wrong with being a Hufflepuff?

I don't expect everyone to be aware of it because everyone treats different news at different priorities. One connection you could make however is how the news media and the government's of both communities tried to smear the people who were telling the truth (Liverpool fans with the crush and Harry and Dumbledore for saying Voldemort was back) by calling them liers and not in their right minds (in the case of Liverpool fans, drunk).

Yes, the systems haven't worked in the past and people have died but to say communism is evil because thousands of people died as a result is ridiculous when you take into account all the people who have died from capitalism.

Britain is socialist? This makes me want to cry as a Brit. The Tories want to privatise everything. They know they can't just sell the NHS off all at once like they did with the railways, the postal service etc so they're selling it off bit by bit so the average person doesn't realise the true extent of what is going on. Jeremy Hunt is currently in the midst of turning our country against the nurses to make his job easier. Also don't get me started the idea of privatising the police force. They've tried to push it threw on a few occasions in sneaky ways. The biggest one was during the Olympics when they hired G4S to do the security. When that failed dramatically, they then had to bring in the army and the police to get involved and sort it out. G4S are also security at youth offender facilities in which there was a documentary recently where they were seen to abuse the children there. To top all that off our Home Secretary Theresa Mays husband is a major shareholder in G4S. I think that's a little suspicious to be honest.

So as it may very well be unheard of for a British player to be recruited before leaving school, it may very well be different in Bulgaria. Then again wasn't Krum was meant to be an exceptionally gifted seeker so he may have been so good they called him up sooner as the World Cup was approaching. I also got the impression that Krum almost single handedly took Bulgaria to the World Cup final as Bulgaria were getting hammered by Ireland but lost by 10 points because of Krum so it wouldn't be a stretch to think that Krum managed to get Bulgaria to the World Cup final on catching the snitch quickly in nearly every game. Then again Ireland were the pre tournament favourites if I recall correctly? I think that was mentioned in PoA.Another reason for young players not playing while at Hogwarts might be when the league seasons are. If like football then the World Cup is played at the end of the English league season so it's not a stretch to presume otherwise with quidditch so English/British players would struggle playing while keeping up with school work while the Bulgarian league could be played in the summer this making it easier for the Bulgarian youths to come through?|||Ok, I get you are coming from but you can't tar all British people with the same brush.

I'm from England and with it being in London I was excited and then you were playing as \\\"revolutionaries\\\" I got even more excited at the beginning then you got to meet Karl Marx which I was absolutely loving and then they go and make him a fucking liberal. I didn't turn the game on the a good month after that. I was so pissed off. Then when they painted Winston Churchill in a positive light about the suffrage movement and they portrayed him as someone who helped with the suffrage movement which in reality he tried his fucking hardest to not let women have the vote. That was so much shit in that game I was so thoroughly pissed off. I know that the Assassin's Creed series is exactly historically accurate but atleast before I was a bit ignorant towards the subject but this time knowing what I know I was fuming. That game was one shit show after another. I'm not even going to buy the next game and Ubisoft have lost a customer because of it.

There seems to be this thing in England where the worst thing in football is a Director of Football despite most of the top clubs in the world actually have a director of football.Tottenhams arguably best side over the last 10 years had a director of football. I'm quite a fan of The approach to be honest.|||Many people continue to still think this.

I was hoping CC would reveal more about their relationship.|||Another deluded prick who absorbs whatever the Daily Mail or the Sun has shoved down his throat. Leading up to this by-election has been one massive smear campaign against labour which did not have the desired effect the media thought it would have which you can tell with articles grasping at straws trying to point out why Corbyn is a shit leader. Yes Labour lost 24 seats in England but the Tories lost London and 35 seats. Baring in mind during the last by-election Lib Dems were at there lowest point ever but have gained seats back because Labour isn't totally catering to the middle class anymore. It still is just not as much. Labour came 3rd in Scotland but the SNP are running a Social Democrat platform which what Labour is supposed to be but hasn't been over the last 20 years so why wouldn't they vote for the SNP who actually have the welfare of the Scottish people as their formost concern?This whole thing has been a total shit show for the last few months but it does show that there is definitely support for Labour out there. I have my own issues with Corbyn but this whole smear campaign is ridiculous. Rant over.Edit: sorry for that, that comment set me off.|||I was a social democrat/ staunch labour before I moved further to the left so moderate left is more me.

The referendum last year was setting up to be a left vs right debate with a few people on each side rebelling against the line and then Boris Johnson happened. He challenged Cameron and it's essentially turned into a leadership battle which obviously the media has run with as it is a lot more entertaining than whatever Corbyn has to say because let's be honest he's hardly a charismatic person.|||Well not Southport exactly (Hesketh Bank) but I went to school in Southport.|||It's funny that your accent has gone more southern.

Basically telling people it's just one goal, no matter how important, one goal does not make a player.|||The only issue we have is lack of competition at full back on both sides but that could be easily remedied with signing a left back and switching Milner to right back. Personally I'd like to add someone like Dahoud for the midfield and another winger similar to ManÃ© so we have more depth of that style of winger but like you said it's just nitpicking really. Jonas Hector is my dream left back though. Couple that with Moreno, we have solid depth at left back. I even quite like Lucas at centre back, it is similar to what I was hoping would happen with Gerrard.|||That's what I thought it was.|||We're a really big club but we're no longer a top club but we have aspirations to be a top top club.

That's my only explanation though. I also found that too. I thought the way Hagrid talked to Harry when he was a baby was a little childish. I know that people act weird and childish around babies anyway but the way Hagrid did it seemed childish in another way if that makes sense? I've seen a few people complain about Ron but I think Ron's character makes sense a lot of the time except for the few goofs he did but other than that Ron would be the embarrassing dad sort of guy.

My structuring of the sentence was wrong so I can see why you thought I meant Billy Beane dropped players.|||Why are they so expensive? Even getting it without the Pokewalker is ridiculous in itself.|||That's true, now it's up to the people to listen.|||Not really because I wasn't arguing about the morality of the use of violence which you clearly are. I just don't think people should take the moral high ground when sometimes violence is the only way some people feel like they can be heard.

I'm not saying it's true but I have seen people say it, mainly on Facebook like but you know what those people are like. Also good points there. Should have called them the New Jersey Red Bulls but that name wouldn't sell would it? Nobody wants to live in Jersey do they? (I would but that's besides the point) You don't not support a team because they're shite and in a shite league. Lower league clubs wouldn't have fans in America if that was the case.Edit: Also could you tell me why the fuck somebody is chainsawing wood at the Portland game?|||Oh and that too but sometimes I can watch a shit film and enjoy it in a way but all the blatant advertisement definitely took away from my attention.|||Caught sleeping with her brother again has she?|||I actually posted this in /r/britishproblems around Christmas.

It just doesn't make sense when they keep switching perspectives if they are travelling with each other.

I don't have the answers but the system we currently live in doesn't work. Bedroom tax for example. Say a small family get a house given to them from the council and they have one bedroom spare why should they pay bedroom tax? They didn't choose the house the council did. I think taxing should be different among the classes or have a set percentage of all the taxes to charge according to wage maybe? I don't know.|||Personally I want to stay in. I know it help feeds capitalism but from what I've seen personally a lot of industries in the UK will go under. I've worked out in the fields on farms, I've worked on factory lines and I've worked in greenhouses from the age of 13 (I come from a bootstrap Tory background, I was forced to work) and the thing I have noticed is that 95% of the workers are Eastern Europeans. The sad fact is that many British people do not want to work these jobs and if we leave the EU then where is a lot of our food going to come from? We wouldn't be able to import from the continent as cheap as we are doing, we wouldn't be growing our own food on such a large scale. I guess I'm looking at this a bit to negatively but that's the only way I see it.|||It depends how he's invested his money.

I do find that interesting though. Many Muslims here to the point where some people expect every Muslim woman to wear one which is obviously not the case. Weird the difference between the culture of the two different groups when all that separates us is the channel. If they tried to bring that law over here even if it is just for public facilities there would be riots. People went crazy after they tried to enforce no burqas in schools. You and me both there mate. I hear from one site it's hell, another will say that many are terrorists so don't let them in and another will say they're all fine, no point moving them on.

I haven't got round to reading it yet, I did pick up a copy from Oxfam a couple of weeks ago.|||Plus what it seemed like to me, Benteke was going to run the ball out of play.|||Well it sometimes kind of is. Our government weren't taking any notice of the suffragettes until they started to be more extreme. The civil rights movement in America had quite a bit of violence involved which MLK supported.

We had Augsburg first game out of the group.|||Is he actually Danish though? He could be Danish American which is of course much more diverse than ordinary Danish.|||Fuck me, I feel like this is one of the biggest problems for England. We cling on to the faintest hope that our \\\"star\\\" players will drag us through. It's such an archaic way of football which doesn't work anymore. Don't get me started on the whole Gerrard and Lampard debacle. They clearly couldn't play together so what do we do? Keep playing them together and look for a solution. Drop one, play the other. Simple. I would have dropped Gerrard just so he'd come back fresh instead of tired or injured.|||Almost then.|||I don't think he's been poor all season and I do think he has his qualities that adds to the side but I do agree with the fact that he is much better in 3 man midfield than a 2 man midfield. His weaknesses are also some of the weaknesses of what Gerrard had towards the end of his time here. He's simply to slow for premier league. If he went another league which is slower I'm sure his qualities would be seen much more than they are in the Premier league.|||The thing is I think a lot of people knew we had a good team but for whatever reason we just weren't gelling. Could it be the style of play Brendan wanted us to play? Could it be the players lost faith in the manager? It could be a whole host of reasons but all we know with the quality that we had on the pitch and on the bench (first time in years I can think of that we have a decent bench) the results we had did not reflect out players abilities.|||I once got accused of stealing bacon from my friends house after a house party.

You'd be surprised, I can't be bothered finding the exact amount of places that had a higher leave percentage but Clacton voted 69.5% leave and there's at least five, possibly more that voted above 70%. I think with Clacton is that they quite like Douglas Carswell as an MP (an issue in itself) as he was the MP there before it was UKIP but for the Tories. He was also the MP of Harwich from 2005 which was what Clacton was before the boundary changes in 2010. So I assume they just like him I guess?|||I can confirm this.

If there is an alien invasion of some kind it's always the US army who are defending the world. Granted other countries would most likely be defending the world during the film but they never even get referenced and it's all about how the US is saving the day. Even in the recent Batman vs Superman film there was definitely an element there when Superman is put on trial, it's not the UN standing him on trial it's the US. Yes he lives in the US but Superman is very much a global \\\"protector.\\\" I get that is probably not the intention of the filmmakers but it can give off that impression. Saying all this I am willing to admit I am probably over analysing these films which are supposed to be a bit of fun.|||Just to also point out, just because you don't go to games does not mean you aren't a real supporter either.Not aiming at you but the football community in general. Football ticket prices are going up and up while wages stay the same, it's becoming impossible for the fans with a low income to go to games. Instead of pointing fingers we need to unite as fans of football to keep the prices from going up.|||Happy yuletide!|||My younger brother says all the time that my older brother doesn't have a sense of humour, I can defensive for him. I don't think he has a decent sense of humour either|||20th century but yeah your point still stands. I have a little anecdote on Thatcher. My great Grandma had dementia later on a life and one day she went missing. The police found her in a local church (family are catholics) they asked all sorts of questions about her friends and family which she couldn't reply because she didn't know. They then asked who the prime minister at that time was and her response \\\"That bitch Thatcher\\\". My great grandma couldn't remember her loved ones but knew how much of a despicable human being Thatcher was. She'd be turning in her grave if she knew my uncle is a Tory councillor.|||I really need to go back to this. I was able to go to the pre launch which meant that quite a few of the interactive exhibits weren't working.|||Some people just want to watch the world burn.|||I misread thought he said England. I was at work so didn't read it properly.|||Didn't realise Cornwell was South Wales.|||Book: Half a King by Joe Abercrombie and I've just finished reading A Song of Ice and FireAnime: Attack On Titan and Yowamushi PedalTV series: Blackadder and Game of ThronesVideo Games: Elder Scrolls Online and The Witcher 3|||I was like that yesterday. I wanted to go on a bike ride all day while at work. I got home, got in my cycling gear and then I spent the next 30 minutes on Reddit.|||I'm guessing it depends on context. I mean in the sense that when I'm talking to a girl and I say something in such away because of my own mannerisms and she then says \\\"aww you're cute.\\\"|||Actually that's exactly what I use to water with and I have done that in the past and no one's has really complained. Thanks for the advice.|||I'm a Keirsly person, I am learning about Jung later this year at college so that could very well change.|||One of my mates is a Spurs fan. I definitely couldn't handle it if they won the league.|||I meant improving cycling. I don't play much football anymore just with my friends really, I don't really like the people who seem to play football in my area. Yeah I was on about soccer. My inner Brit forced me to say football not soccer.|||See I don't think they're bad but for many British people they have a strong good vs evil mentality towards the whole affair. The IRA bombed and killed people in Britain and some people have go as far as calling them murderers etc despite it being a war while completely ignoring what the British army and the Unionists did over in Ireland. There is still very much a pro British imperialist thought with people. That's changing with the younger generations but even so it's still not dead and I think it's one of the reasons why people want to vote out in the EU referendum and why there even is a referendum. Don't get me wrong there are many things wrong with the EU but the reasons why I'd vote out are not the reasons why much of the country would vote out.|||Then there's the bug type that usually takes up another 3 and also the rodent which is normally another 2 so that's 17 so 020 is quite a low number really.|||With a name like Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington I would not be surprised if he did.|||Hedwig! I named my Noctowl Errol.|||When you've just calmed down from being pissed off and someone says to you \\\"are you calm now?\\\" It sends me off again.|||Ah right, thanks mate!|||It's not though is it. It starts in Bridlington on the 1st of May and finish in Leeds on the 3rd of May.|||I really hope Ibe has a good season, he looked like he was lacking a lot of confidence last season. A loan to a premier league club might suit him.|||I'll be at Uni of Manchester (hopefully) next year so I might try and get a ticket for the Man City game.|||I've been saying this for awhile now, the actual hardworkers and the real money makers of this society get the least of what is made. I'll use the place I work as an example. I work in greenhouses which covers several sites. My job is to grow the plants which is arguably the most important job within this company as it is my job to make sure the plants grow to the right size for when they are needed and also make sure they don't die yet there I am paid less than most of the people within the company. I understand the importance of sales and marketing but for them to be on Â£15-20k more than me a year is ridiculous. They even get their own company cars. They even get a lot more than the growing teams manager, I don't think this is right. I do understand the importance of having accountants, logistics and all that but for them to get paid a lot more than me is ridiculous. I quite often work 60 hour weeks while they about 35-37 hours a week. Half the time they're sat around doing nothing and one day they were even playing pool...Edit: I'm not saying pay everyone the same wage but actually pay people a fair wage for how important their job is.|||I don't get the whole \\\"teach men not to rape\\\" thing. Men do already get taught not to rape women. It takes a certain type of person to rape someone and no matter how much teaching I don't think it would change a thing.|||See this is the response I've been wanting to see to this sort of question for awhile. I'm a Pisces so as an TYPE_MENTION the two seem to go hand in hand. That's the only reason I've been half swayed by it for awhile as I am the atypical Pisces.|||Agitate like fuck. We've got to strike while the iron is hot.|||I read a comment the other day which said something like \\\"America was the primary force fighting back the Nazis in World War 2\\\"|||I love winter. I love going for walks in the dark as I think the Dark makes things more beautiful. Also my most stylish clothes are my winter clothes.I do love summer also though, festivals, outdoor concerts and it means I can go out cycling more often without worrying about the rain as much.|||I remember getting yelled at, at school because I ate a piece of bread before we said prayers...|||Exactly why I don't listen to interviews anymore. They are scripted amd spew out the same shit each time.|||I don't know about you mate but it's all over my Facebook right now.|||Because you get a shit load of teens downloading it just because it's Sam Smith. They literally have a chance to listen to it on YouTube before and judge the song as shit but because of the way society is panning out they buy it before they listen to it just so they can say they have the song. It's stupid.|||It's still got that it's a shit hole reputation, I've only been once and that was to go to a \\\"farmers conference\\\" and the area it was in seemed pleasant enough.|||It's alright, atleast you haven't appropriated Socialism for your poke-bourgois gains. My Hawlucha is called Che, Probopass is called Stalin, luxray is called Lenin and  Alakazam is called Marx|||I think the only reason you didn't get the job was because Rafa Benitez got it instead. I'm sure you were second choice.|||Had a rich tea biscuit then? You should have had a hobnob. Those things are like marines.|||I'm ashamed to say atleast 3/4 of my family are Thatcherites and then the majority of the other 1/4 are Blairites.|||How about some of the lovely whores from Lancashire?|||I'm not the one complaining about the game.|||I don't think I will ever get tired of seeing this|||Adding to the pundits finding it easier to follow the narrative. Pundits for years have slated us for using a zonal marking system and I remember a few years ago under Benitez that the pundits constantly slated the zonal marking despite the fact we only conceded once from a corner that season. There are issues with zonal marking but its not as bad as they make out is.|||With Big Sam as manager.|||Me and my housemate one night came up with the Englands Brexit XI:GK: Scott CarsonRB: Jon FlanaganCB: John TerryCB: Ryan ShawcrossLB: Paul KoncheskyRW: Jonjo ShelveyCM: Jay Spearing CM: Lee CattermoleLW: Adam JohnsonST: Jamie VardyST: Andy Carroll\"\n",
